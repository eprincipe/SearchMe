county's plan is garbage trash disposal if something isn't done quickly los angeles city residents will end up making unjustified concessions
$BODY
january monday home edition words the county of los angeles which has historically embraced some
of the nation's sharpest land swindles is out to break new ground in its legacy
of shady real estate deals purportedly acting to provide a badly needed garbage facility the
board of supervisors has secretly approved a plan that will enrich the county bureaucracy and
a high powered developer at the expense of los angeles city taxpayers and santa monica
mountains park users because the city council tentatively approved the plan with little public notice
or review aggressive citizen action is needed to keep it from becoming reality the supervisors
plan begins with a worthy enough goal to construct a readily accessible environmentally sound garbage
disposal facility that can meet countywide needs for half a century the location elsmere canyon
lies in the san gabriel mountains just north of the city county line and along
the antelope valley freeway virtually all the experts agree that elsmere is the appropriate place
for the county's major disposal facility rather than seize with principle this opportunity to meet
public needs the supervisors program threatens establishment of the dump by attaching illegal and unwise
conditions to elsmere's use by all county residents like an entrepreneur in control of a
hot property the county sees elsmere as an opportunity to maximize profits broaden its options
for future trash disposal and realize revenge against an old adversary the city taking advantage
of its public power to condemn the elsmere land the county seeks to extort unjustified
concessions from city residents in particular the supervisors demand as a condition of dumping los
angeles city garbage in elsmere canyon that dumping in lopez canyon be expanded and continued
until even though the site violates state standards that dumping in sunshine canyon also be
expanded even though the operation violates a 25-year-old city permit that the city pay an
extra tribute of at least dollar a ton for dumping at elsmere that can be
increased at the sole discretion of the county and its sanitation district that rustic and
sullivan canyons in the santa monica mountains be sold at market value rather than released
to park agencies at acquisition costs as state law requires the sites are no longer
suitable for dumping but held in trust by the county sanitation district for public recreation
that mission canyon county owned under the same trusteeship as rustic and sullivan canyons not
be released for recreational use but be sold to developer ray watt providing necessary access
to his ambitious and adjacent development extortion of the city is the only glue holding
together the elsmere plan county supervisors have been angry ever since the city closed the
county's mission canyon garbage site in the city used its land-use authority to end dumping
at the facility located within city limits citing harm done to surrounding neighbors in response
the county has prohibited the city from dumping garbage at county sites open to other
municipalities this policy of blackmail designed to force the city to place new garbage dumps
within its borders regardless of the environmental consequences did not work so long as existing
city facilities had not reached capacity but with lopez and sunshine canyons nearing their limits
the extortion becomes more effective alternative solutions exist that would create a garbage facility for
all county residents expand recreational opportunities in the santa monica mountains and end existing conflicts
over garbage dumping next to established neighborhoods the elsmere facility designed to prevent harm to
existing neighbors should be established as soon as possible elsmere should be open at uniform
fees to all residents garbage dumping in lopez and sunshine canyons should terminate when current
permits expire rustic sullivan and mission canyons should be transferred to the santa monica mountains
conservancy for recreation at acquisition cost elsmere's uniform disposal fees should be used to reimburse
the county and its sanitation district for the transfer of the canyons because all county
residents will benefit from this new parkland the state attorney general should immediately prosecute county
officials who maintain the policy of extortion now that the county's secretly formulated plan has
been exposed citizens and their representatives at city hall can force a publicly acceptable substitute
as shown by its vote last month to require separation of household trash the city
council can make sound policy los angeles citizens and their council must undo the county's
attempted swindle of public resources

more harmful than tobacco and a presidential adviser described cocaine as probably the most benign
of illicit drugs currently in widespread use back then police officers fought a dangerous lonely

troopers he was paralyzed nearly two decades ago by a bullet fired while he tried
to serve a search warrant on a suspected cocaine dealer key died last week having
spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair from which he taught youngsters the
dangers of drugs and other temptations of the streets a quadriplegic he still volunteered three
days a week at the gwen bolden foundation an after school counseling program in a
rough neighborhood south of downtown los angeles key was a tutor and a mentor often
for boys with no other man in their lives he bought book packs shoes and
treated youngsters to lunch which was for many their first experience in a restaurant he
quietly did things to teach youngsters to feel good about themselves there was no better
role model in the war against drugs drug use has exploded exponentially since a bullet
cut short key's once bright police career in now it destroys lives families and communities
wholesale as the terror of the nightmare grows more officers like key risk their lives
but as law enforcement leaders are beginning to recognize the war must be waged with
equal fervor against the underlying social causes that make illicit drugs so alluring for so

them to be insensitive but i don't want them to wilt every time something difficult
comes along my wife and i aren't wealthy so they're going to have to make
it on their own t s dear t s the fact that you're aware that
youngsters need to be able to cope with frustration and disappointment is already a plus
children need to learn how to cope with defeat and parents need to explain that
we all learn from our failures if a child doesn't know this he may limit
himself by trying only those tasks he knows he can do well when things go
wrong when your youngster gets a disappointing grade or when he fails on a test
help him not to be overcome by these setbacks remind him that they are temporary
and that he can learn from his past errors and do better next time michael
scheier a psychologist at carnegie mellon university found that optimists handle stress better than pessimists
optimists tend to respond to disappointments by formulating a plan of action and asking other
people for help and advice while pessimists are likely to react to the same difficulties
by trying to forget the whole thing or by assuming there's nothing they can do
to change things dear dr brothers i'm engaged to a wonderful woman but i'm troubled
by what happens to her when she drinks first of all she doesn't seem to
know when to stop and when i mention this the next day she gets defensive
assuring me that she can stop whenever she wants i know that after we've been
celebrating at a party she doesn't remember things that have happened the night before this
is important because she frequently behaves badly how can i handle this and should i
insist that she go on the wagon f t dear f t i doubt that
you'd accomplish much if you simply insisted that she go on the wagon she's showing
symptoms of alcoholism such as personality changes when she drinks denial about her drinking patterns
and blackouts or memory lapses while some non-alcoholics do occasionally experience these same symptoms it's
unusual and is a strong indication that there are serious drinking problems there are ways
to spot future alcoholics such as the need to find constant excuses for a drink
and the pattern of having every occasion sad or happy begin and end with a
drink another clue that you seem to be getting is the inability of your friend
to stop drinking or to refuse alcohol once she's started try to get her to

january monday home edition words a place of light by mary bush morrow pps i
had four sisters in my life but maude is the only one alive a boy
in his teens tells us in one of these stories that's because his mother has
the nasty habit of killing off her babies when they cry too much all of
the short stories in this sober brilliant collection are set in rural poverty stricken upstate
new york deserted backwaters where there are no jobs the land is played out the
smart enterprising people have left and the collective gene pool is something you wouldn't want
to dive into what are we and by that pronoun i mean the educated the
orderly even the enlightened readers scanning this review right now to make of stories like
these my feeling is that having lived through the so-called holiday season many of us
have had to notice once again that human emotions are often irrational and base that
maybe of all parents wish devoutly that they'd never had their children maybe of all
children even in these enlightened times grow up in terror of their parents and if
they live long enough are able to turn the tables on those creatures who have
been so penurious with their affection and so prodigal with their insults and their dreadful
threats their pledges of undying hatred the child has no recourse but to live long
enough stick around and make his or her abusive parents miserable and afraid something to
live for in these trying times this collection deals with several levels of terror that
perhaps all children have to deal with at one level or another underground railroad with
its baby slaughtering mother is only the most extreme example here some of these tales
seem comparatively innocuous muskrat and rude awakening are both gender oriented coming-of-age stories in the
former two small boys set out to trap muskrat and end up with something large
and alive that isn't a muskrat already suffering terribly from the cramped iron trap on
its leg too fearful to let it loose too fearful to admit their fear the
boys finally suffocate the animal by burying it alive in stones harmless maybe boys will
be boys and all that but this stolid indifference to suffering comes back to haunt
the reader in another story as two adult hunters carelessly terrorize a young couple in
the woods in rude awakening a young girl cordially detested by her mother is forced
to put aside her overalls and don a white veil for her first communion she
gets sick and after long and horrible minutes finally spits out the host again no
harm is done all little girls get sick but her alienation from her family her
sense of being totally alone in the world is confirmed forever some of these stories
emerge from poverty so that if we own a microwave and an automatic coffee pot
or are saving our money in cds we may be able to persuade ourselves that
they are not our stories in difficult passage a little girl wheels her legless grandpa
to the circus to see freaks realizing in the process that the poverty stricken people
in her own town are not just the audience but freaks as well in two
separate stories incest or plain child molestation may be blamed on unemployment if uncle jojo
in outlaws or the repellent robert in a place of light had decent jobs perhaps
they wouldn't spend their waking hours trying to have sex with small girls but i
don't believe money fixes everything and neither does the author in two stories unexpectedly sanctuaries
appear out in grim woods where people manage to live in harmony with their surroundings
and with self respect just seeing these places these people heartens other characters trapped in
their own misery maybe it is possible to live another way in a decent way
always with stories like this there is that lame editorial attempt at distancing in a
downright pitiful blurb of this book someone writes harsh lives make for compelling drama maybe
but i have a feeling the world is made up of those who know these
stories are reality and others who peek into these pages play dumb and say yum
yum look at all these harsh lives and all this compelling drama those who know
this grim reality will take these stories straight to their sad hearts not one other
family looked like theirs one lost little girl thinks no one was making a scene
no one else was miserable but a lot of other people even with dad hauling
in the bucks and mom wearing a giant gold necklace are starving right now for
love or dry as a bone they know themselves unable to give that love that's
not compelling drama that's reality mary bush reminds all of us that paradoxically in our
terrible isolation we're not alone

art review the eccentric buddhist vision of ito jakuchu greengrocer and artist
$BODY
january monday home edition words an exhibition of japanese paintings that caused a stir last
fall in new york recently arrived at the los angeles county museum of art the
paintings of jakuchu which features an astonishing range of works by one of 18th century
japan's authentically great individualists is certain to captivate aficionados as well as visitors who just
wander into the museum jakuchu's colorfully painted scrolls depicting flora and fauna are so profusely
detailed and brilliantly designed that they defy imagining how any mere human being could have
created them at the opposite extreme is his breathtakingly minimal series of six ink-on-paper scrolls
called lotus pond the quiet scene melts away into a central space that appears to
be empty but is actually filled with the specter of death and winter between these
two poles of jakuchu's sensibility are relatively crude paintings of clay dolls striking woodblock prints
of bright birds on velvety black backgrounds and seriously a funeral scene portraying the dead
buddha as a radish surrounded by mourning vegetables there's a certain logic to vegetable parinirvana
the improbable and apparently irreverent death scene ito jakuchu 1716 1800 was the son of
a greengrocer and ran the family's wholesale business for years before he became a full
time artist at he may have been more at home with the mushrooms persimmons yams
and cucumbers in his parody than with human characters an assiduous observer of nature jakuchu
also raised chickens and elevated them to lofty heights of grace and beauty in his
paintings environment may account for some of his subject matter but there's no explaining the
innovative talent and brilliant eccentricity that has distinguished jakuchu in the annals of japanese painting
a born artist he was ill-suited to business and eventually unloaded that burden on a
younger brother jakuchu had classical training in japanese painting and drew inspiration from chinese painters
but he developed such an unusual style that he stands out as an eccentric one
wonders how he got away with it but in fact he was highly regarded during
his life jakuchu had the good fortune to live in kyoto during a peaceful time
when a spirit of experimentation and individuality was in vogue he initially gained fame for
his masterpiece a series of vividly painted scrolls known as the colorful realm of living
beings painted from about to the scrolls are a pictorial encyclopedia of plants and animals
interpreted according to jakuchu's vision of peace and prosperity he presented the scrolls in to
shokukuji a zen temple in kyoto they are part of the imperial household collection and
are rarely put on public exhibition examples currently on display in los angeles are panels
called mandarin ducks in snow hydrangeas and fowl fish in a lotus pond golden pheasants
in snow and birds and peonies all are poetic marriages of flora and fauna so
closely entwined that they seem to be of a piece striking in composition characterized by
sweeping curves and rhythmic repetition the scrolls are skillfully detailed down to the last detail
of the last feather these color paintings represent one major component of jakuchu's work the
other is ink paintings that reveal the artist's devotion to zen strictly speaking however the
ink paintings do not conform to zen principles despite their enormous energy and directness they
are more calculated less spontaneous in feeling than classical zen works jakuchu was a lay
zen priest so his affinity to the philosophy's artistic precepts are expected but he was
also such an individualist that he inevitably came up with his own style it is
typified by such ink paintings as two roosters and a hen and pine plum and
crane which contrast dramatic shapes and patterns with open space about works on loan from
japanese collections are on view on the lower floor of the ahmanson building but they
are only the beginning of a three course jakuchu banquet because of japanese government regulations
and the fragility of the works the paintings of jakuchu is being presented in two
parts part i continues through jan part ii will be shown from jan to feb
each portion contains a full chronological range of the artist's work so that visitors who
only see one part can grasp the whole of his oeuvre the third course of
the banquet is an auxiliary exhibition to feb in the japanese pavilion the colorful realm
of jakuchu and jakuen consists of works by the master and his most prominent student
jakuen from american collections the metropolitan museum of art in new york the denver art
museum and four private collectors have loaned pieces that complement the county museum of art's
extensive jakuchu collection

of balmy revelry complete with suntanned princesses football players in short sleeves swirls of flowers
and sun-dappled mountains then migrating like lemmings dazzled television viewers join the westward march so
goes the theory for a century pasadenans have treasured that vision of their city as
a place where dreams come true and the weather's fine any time of year but
behind the image of civilized hoopla is a complicated city of struggling fitfully to reconcile
its diverse elements these days the once idyllic community which seems to stretch across the
map of the western san gabriel valley like a child's bib has gangs drugs smog
and a running debate on development but it also can boast of visionary entrepreneurship socially
concerned city leaders impressive arts and educational institutions and especially during the holiday season a

aside our troubles and differences and focus on the good things in our lives the
rose parade which began years ago as a horse-and-buggy romp through wrestern pasadena now cuts
through the geographical and economic heart of the city for discerning pasadenans the mile parade
route represents a brief tour of the city's high points and low points it begins
fittingly on orange grove boulevard where the city itself began in the late 19th century
the parade starts out from the heart of well-to-do pasadena in a palmy section south
of the rose bowl called millionaire's row by a m today when the riverside community
college marching tigers band leads the parade down the boulevard the neighborhood will be crammed
with floats and marchers for well heeled residents this is something between a nuisance and
a blessing you sort of can't live with it and you can't live without it
said ken grobecker who grumbles good naturedly about the parade goers who jam the west

of art then moving into old pasadena the city's commercial district old pasadena is where
city planners like to tout their city's spirit of creativity in less than years the

their grandmother stonestreet's problems began when after a long custody fight for her children now
and she was dismissed by the pharmaceutical firm where she had worked for years welfare
sent me to a shelter in downtown los angeles she said sobbing quietly i was
terrified i came back to pasadena and told the social worker it was unbelievable i'd
rather sleep on the streets over here than go back over there this is the
neighborhood where the underclass of pasadena lives predominantly black northwest pasadena had about drive-by shootings
in six people were killed and injured many of them innocent bystanders in shooting incidents
police say the neighborhood also has many hard working homeowners and apartment dwellers sometimes overwhelmed
by the crime around them the attitude by the authorities seems to be as long
as it's not blown out of proportion let it go one resident said it's a
population that's basically a labor population but there's not a single smokestack in pasadena said
ibrahim naeem director of the pasadena foothill branch of the los angeles urban league the
result is a vast gap between haves and have nots a city commission on youth
and families recently compared income levels in a census tract in northwest pasadena with one
in wealthy west pasadena they found a difference in median family income often that gap
translates into a black pasadena and a white pasadena black leaders contend the city's attitude
in the past can be called neglect at best naeem said the board of city
directors pasadena's city council has tried recently to assuage the restive black community which constitutes
about of the city last month after months of criticism the board authorized a audit
of city personnel practices to determine whether city policies have been racist or sexist over
the past five years when the parade reaches the corner of marengo avenue it is
in developer territory say slow growth activists the construction of the two-block plaza pasadena mall
between marengo and los robles avenues was one of the first signs that the city
was on a no-holds-barred growth track said mike salazar co-chairman of pasadenan residents in defense
of our environment pride after when the community redevelopment agency demolished such older structures as
the pasadena athletic club to make way for the mall slow growth resistance started to
build there were early battles like a petition drive that ultimately stopped a plan for
twin office towers in the middle of town but boxy office towers continued to spring
up particularly along traffic clogged lake and los robles avenues city planners say office buildings
have been built in the city since almost doubling office space to about million square
feet at the same time condominium projects popped up like toadstools people would go to
the city and complain that it wasn't fair to their neighborhoods which had been single
family homes for years said claire bogaard executive director of the preservation group pasadena heritage
but generally the developers got their way the scene was set for a battle at
the polls last march pride won as of the voters approved a measure to restrict
new housing and large commercial projects city leaders worry that the measure will stifle the
entrepreneurial spirit that brought pasadena out of economic doldrums it's already causing a housing scarcity
and driving up prices mayor thomson said william podley president of the pasadena based real
estate firm of podley caughey associates says prices are indeed skyrocketing properties we handled last
year for or are going for maybe even he said the parade passes hill avenue
a main thoroughfare for pasadena city college and a few blocks to the south caltech
a mile north of the route on washington boulevard mary donikian doles out baklava for
a customer at the american armenian grocery it is a fragrant place full of the
dried fruits nuts and cheeses that armenians serve during the holidays armenians used to celebrate
christmas on jan commemorating the arrival of the three kings on the day of epiphany
but we're getting used to american ways said donikian who came to the united states
from lebanon years ago getting used to those ways has been tough going for many
of pasadena's armenians refugees from discrimination in the middle east and repression in the soviet
union most arrive with little knowledge of english and few job skills yet pasadena has
accepted them with extraordinary generosity armenian leaders say in the board of directors gave armenians
a special protected status in awarding city contracts and recruiting for city jobs now a
polling firm is conducting the first ever armenian census to implement an affirmative action program
it has not been easy sledding said serge samoniantz whose firm is doing the census
those who have had experience with local government in the soviet union are extremely distrustful
of anything that smacks of government samoniantz said a hard right onto sierra madre boulevard
and the parade comes to rest in victory park where the colorful floats are then
put on display it's an appropriate resting place eastern pasadena is the middle income home
owning bedrock of the city the residents here are civil servants contractors small business owners
a few blocks east of victory park is upper hastings ranch a hillside neighborhood of
winding streets and slanted roofs the holiday season is their neighborhood's time to shine for
the past years residents have lit up the night with a torrent of christmas lights
so extravagant is the display that tour buses and long lines of cars edge through

man fatally stabbed in pizza restaurant crime victim crashes child's birthday party and argues with his estranged girlfriend the boy's mother she is arrested
$BODY
january monday home edition words a man was fatally stabbed by his estranged girlfriend after
he crashed a birthday party for her 3-year-old son saturday night at a crowded family
pizza restaurant in granada hills police said robert bridges a millwright from apple valley was
stabbed once or twice in the chest in a quarrel with cynthia stafford of pacoima
los angeles police detective ken buscarino said bridges died at about a m sunday at
holy cross medical center in mission hills stafford who was described as unemployed was being
held without bail on suspicion of murder police said the couple had lived together about
six months before breaking up and bridges apparently went to the restaurant to try to
revive the relationship buscarino said the detective said stafford went to the chuck e cheese's
pizza time theater with her son about five other children and as many as adult
friends and relatives bridges showed up uninvited at about p m he was not the
boy's father but he had apparently befriended him when he was with the mother and
somehow learned about the party the detective said the couple had a lengthy argument buscarino
said stafford left the restaurant and walked to a nearby supermarket where she bought a
10-inch steak knife and returned the detective said the stabbing took place about p m
near a salad bar in a dining room some distance away from the youngsters at
the birthday party who apparently did not witness it buscarino said however the detective added
officers interviewed about eyewitnesses i'm sure a lot of people saw it and grabbed their
kids and left as fast as they could detective john birrer said i'm surprised as
many people hung around as they did by the time we got there buscarino said
bridges was aware that stafford had a knife but he may have thought she was
just threatening him but he was wrong she did him in it went down quickly
the detective said bridges got stabbed and he didn't fall down or scream he was
able to stand upright until his friends in the party drove him to the hospital
stafford's son was placed in the custody of his maternal grandmother buscarino said a woman
who identified herself as stafford's mother said she was at work several weeks ago when
her daughter phoned to report that bridges was at the pacoima home stafford and her
son share with her he was just banging on the door pounding pounding pounding i
could hear it through the telephone the woman said i told my supervisor i had
to leave because somebody's trying to break into my house when i got here he
was still pounding hell he's a damn nut and i guess she is too the

science medicine growth hormones use of these expensive and experimental hormones presents an ethical dilemma in a society that often measures a person's worth by his height hormones pressure to help children grow taller is strong but many experts are uncertain about the long term risks and effects
$BODY
january monday home edition words imagine a world in which short children are treated with
a drug to make them taller although it borders on the brave new world depicted
in the 1930s novel by aldous huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so
that they developed standard traits the technology necessary to turn this science fiction into fact
is already being explored for decades physicians have been treating some midget children with growth
hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they reach adulthood
unlike dwarfs who have disproportionately large heads in relation to their limbs and torso midgets
are proportionately short but only since has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the
hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are growing so
slowly that they are not expected to reach more than feet inches if they are
boys or feet inches if girls the national institute of child health and human development
in bethesda md is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth hormone
in these normal children who unlike midgets do not have a classic growth hormone deficiency
the results will not be in for at least years but that has not stopped
some doctors from using the therapy on such children the use of growth hormone is
presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that often measures the worth of people by
their height others argue that no substance regardless of one's ethical point of view should
be used widely until it is proven safe and effective at a recent state of
the art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by the swedish medical research council in
stockholm about the only point experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests
used to detect a growth hormone deficiency are not reliable said louis underwood a university
of north carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference without dependable tests physicians cannot separate
children who are growing slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth
hormone production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being short while
it makes sense that physicians should correct the former treating genetically short children with the
hormone raises thorny ethical issues short stature is not necessarily a disease points out leona
cuttler a university of chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the journal of the
american medical assn last year but part of the normal variation in human appearance physicians
who try to boost a normal short child's height with growth hormone may be likened
to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance with nose jobs and tummy tucks but
consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures not children because growth hormone therapy is only
thought to be effective in children and not full grown adults a child's parents and
physician must decide if he should be treated we have to be very careful when
deciding whom to treat says pediatric endocrinologist gilbert august of george washington university often it
isn't the kids who are worried about being short but their parents these parents who
are short themselves vicariously relive through the child their own failures in high school about
not being able to make the team etc i've often joked that if you could
just do a parentectomy these kids would be fine but even without parental pressures short
stature can be emotionally costly in our society which values height the money you save
by not giving growth hormone says august you may as well give to a psychiatrist
some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height with taller people making more
money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than shorter individuals the midgets who
portrayed the munchkins in the movie the wizard of oz for example earned less money
than the dog toto short height however is a relative term that is dependent on
the range of height in a population when august told a group of dwarfs for
example about the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's
final adult height from feet inch to feet inches they were horrified people feet tall
are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than feet inches he explained by
definition a child is short if he is in the lowest of height in a
normal population but if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children with growth
hormone they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a new crop of short
kids there will always be someone in the short range of normal where to draw
the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a dilemma we're struggling
with right now says pediatric endocrinologist susan rose of the university of new mexico medical
center in albuquerque the high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue we're
talking to per inch says pediatric endocrinologist melvin grumbach of uc san francisco is a
few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to send a kid to college
another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone grumbach added is
that the jury is still out on the effectiveness and long term safety of the
therapy used on these children if you know a therapy is effective and has no
risk tied to it you do it says endocrinologist gordon cutler of the national institute
of child health and human development but if both the risk and the effectiveness are
uncertain you should do nothing and let nature take its course or you should enroll
the patient in a clinical trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits
are there are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy but there are
some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy which usually consists of three injections of the
hormone per week for several years might boost a person's chances of developing diabetes hypothyroidism
or leukemia if we knew the therapy would give a person a four inch gain
in their final adult height rather than just a two-inch gain the risks are probably
worth taking says cutler but we don't know that yet since most normal children who
have been tested with growth hormone therapy have not reached adulthood yet their final gain
in height is not known in the meantime the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat
more short children with growth hormone is building unfortunately everybody imbues growth hormone with magical
qualities because we value growth so much says rose what decisions pediatricians make on whom
to treat with growth hormone will have bearing on the use of future therapies likely
to be developed to boost the appearance rather than the health of children if pediatricians
do not respond to these dilemmas thoughtfully carefully and forcefully cuttler wrote in her article
other decision makers whose decisions may reflect political social or market forces may then respond
in ways that do not reflect the best interests of children

diverse l a drug culture threatens aids outreach
$BODY
january monday home edition words paul rosas and ronny alvarado were out trawling for hypes
in a wild pocket of downtown los angeles carrying the message about aids and dirty
needles to an urban prairie where an addict can get high for as little as
cents a man squatted on the curb pumping heroin into a dappled arm nearby another
guided a skillet over an open fire sauteing fish people stood slumped against a chain
link fence smoking cocaine a woman flashed a leering grin at alvarado alvarado approached her
had she heard about aids did she know the risks of dirty needles and unprotected
sex could she use a few condoms nope the woman retorted perfunctorily she was a
woman she didn't need one it's not easy spreading the word about aids to intravenous
drug users now a prime target of the epidemic in los angeles county the obstacles
range from the life styles of many addicts to the complex culture of drug use
in the nation's second largest city geography is destiny in los angeles county the sprawl
of the region has shaped the drug market and thus the aids epidemic the county's
vastness has slowed the spread of aids among drug users but it is making it
difficult to reach those at greatest risk in east coast cities like new york intravenous
drug use is centralized hundreds of addicts share needles daily in shooting galleries as a
result more than half of new york city's estimated addicts are believed to be infected
with the aids virus but that same density makes addicts easy to find public health
workers routinely canvass the shooting galleries of cities such as new york and newark they
have alerted addicts to the risk of aids and thus helped cut down on the
sharing of contaminated needles in los angeles county by contrast there are few places except
skid row where addicts congregate in large numbers drug use is spread out and tends
to occur among small groups those who share needles tend to do so with a
few friends again and again for that reason and the fact that the virus came
late to the west coast the hiv infection rate among addicts here appears to have
remained relatively low just to of the county's estimated to intravenous drug users are infected
researchers believe difficult to reach but that same diffuseness makes it difficult to reach users
they are scattered all over the county only occasionally in pockets public health workers find
themselves forced to go door to door scouring neighborhoods for an entree hoping to happen
upon a user gangs too create obstacles to spreading the word their role in drug
dealing creates risks for public health workers in some areas most outreach workers say they
avoid working after dusk the time when some acknowledge addicts are most accessible the county's
cultural mix makes their task even more complex in some latino communities experts say addicts
are inadvertently protected sheltered at home rather than forced out they are harder to reach
their families may offer the only access intravenous drug use is happening all over said
john l brown who runs one of the five county funded programs doing outreach with
addicts but it manifests itself differently depending on culture socioeconomic circumstances and even the neighborhood
so what really burns me is people from san francisco and new york who say
this is how you do street outreach said brown director of the los angeles centers
for alcohol and drug abuse it's a much more complicated problem than that but without
effective outreach experts believe infection inevitably will spread many addicts here admit they still share
needles and syringes those who use bleach to sterilize their equipment say they do so
only intermittently many use condoms only rarely yet condoms offer the only means of avoiding
infection during sex one preliminary survey of addicts in the san fernando valley found that
needle sharing remains common yet use of bleach to clean needles was relatively rare many
of the users surveyed had multiple sex partners or frequented prostitutes but few reported using
condoms even so county funded aids outreach workers remain barred by the board of supervisors
from giving out condoms or bleach an approach used widely elsewhere in the united states
and abroad and credited with having helped change addicts behavior among the homeless activists believe
drug use is rising among bisexual drug users as many as to may be infected
researchers say some say there may also be a microepidemic of infection among the county's
prostitutes others in the field see a rise in dual addiction especially among mexican american
addicts the supplementing of a heroin habit with low-priced cocaine they find that ominous dual
addiction is especially risky and can be more difficult to treat treatment getting off drugs
is the ultimate form of aids risk reduction but access to programs remains a problem
in the county the wait for admission to a subsidized program ranges from weeks to
months and the price often serves as a powerful deterrent what makes people comfortable ignoring
the threat of aids for addicts is the thought that if they wanted help they
could get it brown said the reality is if they all decided to kick there's
nothing for them how fast the aids virus is spreading among drug users is not
entirely clear m douglas anglin who heads ucla's drug abuse research group has studied rates
of infection among addicts in treatment his findings and others suggest that perhaps were infected
in and that the rate is still below history of drug use according to those
studies the virus appears to be pooled among male intravenous drug users with some history
of homosexual activity and among women intravenous drug users with some history of prostitution anglin
said but some authorities have wondered whether the findings are reliable that is are addicts
in treatment representative of addicts on the street if men and women in treatment are
less likely to be infected the overall rate could be higher anglin expressed confidence in
the data he said the county could have as much as a three to-five-year grace
period before the infection rate reaches that critical to level at which a rapid rise
could be expected to occur who are the drug users at risk in los angeles
county they are as diverse as the county itself they include longshoremen physicians mothers truck
drivers and prostitutes from san pedro and east los angeles to the san fernando valley
their drugs of choice and their using patterns vary widely heroin remains dominant among latino
addicts experts say cocaine has eclipsed heroin in the black community both those drugs as
well as methamphetamine and pcp are widely used by anglos the following sketches hint at
the extraordinary diversity of drug use in los angeles county while the people profiled have
escaped infection their stories illustrate the insidious power of addiction and a life style with
potentially lethal consequences take cheryl a 33-year-old mother of three from east los angeles who
asked not to be identified by her real name experts in drug addiction say her
experience is common among women addicts they fall into drug use on the heels of
men cheryl grew up in east los angeles one of five children her father is
a transit worker one sister is an aspiring wrestler she completed high school and she
says she had little interest in drugs until she met the man who would become
her second husband ten years ago faced with his growing addiction cheryl tried heroin it
was a reckless bid for attention his drug use seemed to have shouldered her out
of his life she followed him into the bathroom where he was fixing and insisted
he inject her too for several years cheryl used only occasionally but when her husband
began dealing they both began using more often emerging horrified from a two-week binge she
resolved to quit but when she tried she became violently intolerably sick after her husband
was sent to prison cheryl tried to control her habit she held down a job
and cared for her children then one day an old connection showed up at the
furniture warehouse where she worked as a favor he gave her some heroin to sell
cheryl began dealing and used up the rest of the supply from there she slid
into prostitution she lost jobs was sent to jail and was briefly cut off by
her family she remembers spending christmas on her parents front porch barred from the house
in this type of life it's nothing but an evil merry-go-round she said recently in
an interview at a methadone maintenance program where she is enrolled it's a vicious master
you go in a circle it's a never ending circle a similar tale comes from
a man who asked to identify himself only as doc a 35-year-old psychologist living in
los angeles county he began using heroin while working as a drug addiction researcher at
a prominent southern california university intrigued by the world of the men and women he
was interviewing in motel rooms throughout the state doc began experimenting with heroin he compares
his curiosity to that of an apple researcher who has never tasted the fruit i
wanted to taste the apple two years ago he began using more frequently driving from
his home in the san fernando valley to the heart of east los angeles to
score even after his wife overdosed and with a 10-month-old child at home doc found
himself powerless to quit rebuilding his life early last year he entered a residential treatment
program his wife had left him taking their child he was having difficulty holding down
jobs he has remained clean ever since he says and is in the process of
piecing together his life it will kill you said doc who like cheryl escaped without
becoming infected with the human immuno deficiency virus which causes aids if you're lucky it
will only kill you psychologically so you have a chance for another life contrary to
stereotypes the life of an addict can be cruelly demanding in ways that make it
difficult to get the aids message across it is a life in which immediate needs
eclipse longer term goals in which caution is not a top priority many addicts for
example rise before dawn to get high then they turn immediately to the urgent business
of securing their next fix a task that may entail shoplifting theft prostitution moving hot
goods wheeling and dealing or selling drugs paul rosas a former addict supported his habit
for a time by ripping off other addicts peddling crack vials filled with soap or
peanuts he became so hated on the streets that he recalls he could only come
out at night his head covered by a hood personal hygiene even eating often fall
by the wayside many addicts have chronic health problems from tooth decay to liver and
lung disease suspicious of institutions and sometimes mistreated by doctors many shy away from medical
clinics there's no reality outside of the next two to three hours said barbara casucci
director of cornerstone health services a methadone program in pico rivera there's no long term
planning no looking forward to christmas or easter it's just how are you going to
get through the next two or three hours for that reason among others aids outreach
workers have a hard job just getting the attention of an addict on the street
is no small feat what should be a 20-minute presentation on aids and how to
avoid it ends up abbreviated into a fleeting one-minute rap then there's the problem of
vocabulary both language and lingo in some communities adults find it difficult to talk about
sex on skid row phrases like intravenous drug user are jettisoned in favor of more
graphic alternatives such as d'you slam bleach and condoms many outreach workers say would make
their job easier they would catch addicts attention and give them something for their time
they would also serve as invaluable tools in explaining precisely how to protect oneself against
aids in the absence of those tools outreach workers fall back on the power of
repetition by being visible on the streets and offering repeated reminders they hope they will
eventually get across their point ongoing process these people are busy they're trying to get
money trying to get paid trying to get high said rosas who does outreach along
skid row for brown's agency it's an ongoing process no one's going to learn this
in one shot one afternoon this month rosas threaded his way down the crowded sidewalks
of downtown los angeles making his regular rounds past the park where addicts gather past
the curbside cardboard dormitories past hotels where transvestites co-habit four to a room traveling with
him was ronny alvarado a 20-year-old former addict who works with the homeless outreach project
a skid row agency that among other things accompanies aids outreach workers and makes available
free condoms and bleach that agency's funding comes from the city not the county so
it is not bound by the county supervisors ban on distributing condoms and bleach the
two men loped through the streets greeting familiar faces cajoling passers-by scanning arms and necks
for tracks they offered pamphlets condoms information some people listened others kept walking a few
protested in mock offense they were happily married you can't push yourself on nobody out
here explained rosas a 225-pound man with a buzz cut who put in his own
time on the new york city streets you got to know when to step when
to go if you don't you may end up dead where you stand over the
hills in the san fernando valley three aids outreach workers from an agency called el
proyecto del barrio were working van nuys moving methodically from house to house on a
run-down street where residents said drug deals regularly go down there the obstacles are different
drug use goes on mostly behind closed doors the biggest problem is identifying where these
people are said john paloma one of the outreach workers then when you've found them
it's convincing them we're not the police the outreach workers watch for tell tale signs
cars pulling up outside certain houses visitors returning one time too often they ask questions
any signs of drug use in the neighborhood they hope their message makes its way
into the right hands in paloma's experience most addicts now know about bleach whether they
use it he cannot be certain most say they no longer share equipment but paloma
remembers when he was using everyone shared because no one wanted to be caught carrying
an outfit for that reason paloma used to stash equipment around town for example high
atop public toilets now working the parks he occasionally runs a hand through those familiar
crannies when he comes upon a syringe he leaves a pamphlet are outreach programs working
in los angeles county it is difficult to know most programs have been operating little
more than a year and there has been so far no comprehensive study assessing whether
addicts practices have changed el proyecto del barrio the agency that covers the san fernando
valley recently completed a survey of intravenous drug users the findings are preliminary and the
study sample small but the results indicate there is more work to be done sharing
needles nearly of those surveyed said they share needles at least occasionally more than half
said they clean their equipment with water which is ineffective only one third said they
cleaned their equipment with bleach and water the only proven method as for sex said
they had multiple partners nearly one in five said they frequented prostitutes yet most never
use condoms and only use them sometimes four people said they used them all the
time changing attitudes and behavior takes time said kimberly green outreach project coordinator for el
proyecto del barrio eventually they hit bottom then they become more vulnerable those spreading the
word say they have no grandiose expectations we're not out to solve the problem of
aids said mike neely who runs the homeless outreach project out of a storefront in
the heart of skid row what we're trying to do is keep the person in
front of us alive long enough to deal with their life if we can keep
the person alive til they're ready to hear the message maybe they'll be ok said
neely if they die first all we've got is a dead drug addict

the movement has become too powerful too intrusive and whether preservation and progress are compatible
and affordable the questions take on added weight as aging cities increasingly rely on historic
districts to attract visitors and help fuel their service economies across the nation preservationists are
battling to hold onto power they gained during the last several decades of heightened awareness
of architectural treasures in charleston s c and san francisco preservationists have taken a beating
as they tried to convince some victims of the recent hurricane and earthquake that in
repairing their damaged property they should spend the extra money it takes to buy materials
like those destroyed rather than purchasing newer cheaper ones pat mellen of the preservation society
of charleston said to be the nation's oldest such organization years old said you have
to explain to them that you can put an asphalt roof on instead of the
more expensive metal but you're going to lose it in years you're also going to
lose tourism because the houses would not be attractive in south pasadena calif homeowners backed
by the national trust for historic preservation struggle against a freeway that would destroy dozens
of historic houses one angry homeowner called that prospect cultural suicide the preservationists can lay
claim to holding off the freeway for years but they have not been able to
kill it the state continues to press forward with new plans in madison ga preservationists
sought to block the opening of a hardee's hamburger shop which would result in the
razing of two historic homes in the quaint old east georgia town but they lost
the restaurant now sits just off the town's main square painted white like many of
the historic homes around it it's the only antebellum hardee's in the world said don
stacy of the local chamber of commerce adding that a piggly wiggly grocery store is
located just across the street from hardee's i wouldn't call it an antebellum piggly wiggly
he said but it is a quality construction with a quality appearance influence considerable for
many years the preservation movement made great political headway and its influence is still considerable
even dominating in many communities the national trust has identified areas nationwide that it calls
endangered including south pasadena st simons ga and the historic district in deadwood s d
these places tell us who we were and who we are said national trust president
j jackson walter they deserve our protection but a backlash of sorts has been building
and nowhere is it more apparent than in savannah where a square mile historic district
graced by live oak trees dripping spanish moss boasts of some historic buildings and landscaped
squares savannah is among the nation's oldest planned cities james oglethorpe laid it out in
and possesses one of america's largest urban historic areas designated as a landmark district by
the u s interior department thus the plight of its preservation establishment could set a
pattern for others nationwide savannah along with other cities like charleston san antonio and annapolis
that have been working to preserve their history are the recognized and acknowledged exemplaries of
historic preservation walter said were it ever to be the case when one of those
cities changed direction sharply we would i am certain be alarmed that other preservation efforts
might be thwarted when the leaders fall everybody else gets nervous sweeping control preservation officials
exercise broad control over how a building is modified and over whether one is built
at all in this city of an 11-member historic board of review that includes architects
builders and historians must approve any type of alteration that is visible from the public
right of way said beth reiter savannah's preservation officer the board is appointed by mayor
john rousakis and the board of aldermen serving three year terms the following changes are
among those requiring a certificate of appropriateness approved by the board and issued by the
zoning commissioner demolition of a historic structure in the historic district material change in the
exterior appearance of structures in the district moving a structure into within or out of
the district adding or altering awnings material change of existing walls fences or sidewalks that
are subject to view from a public street or lane under a section of the
ordinance called visual compatibility factors there are categories for judging new construction and proposed changes
they range from height to roof shape to the rhythm relationship of the buildings with
other structures preservationists argue that such considerations are not trivial as they make a city
palatable to visitors thereby making money if we do not safeguard the character of our
community if we allow it to fray around the edges people are not going to
be interested in coming to see it said stephanie churchill executive director of the historic
savannah foundation behaving like nazis however many here argue that focusing on the past is
preventing progress for the future the board is behaving like nazis or like czars hall
said that's not what i want in my government many people here disparage preservation officials
and some have become local celebrities by defying city orders based on preservation officials judgments
michael faber a savannah delicatessen owner ran up against the wrath of preservationists when he
put up a red awning at his restaurant located in the historic district despite the
fact that his sandwiches passed strenuous taste tests he won his fight but his bitterness
tinged with humor lingers preserve the cemetery faber exhorts but don't put the businessman in
it one after another he zings one-liners at preservationists having them sit around a table
demanding to see paint samples is like rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic and
if the world stopped it would take savannah years to catch up and just to
rub in his indignation on city officials faber makes sure his bright red awning is
well lighted at night so they don't miss it his matching red window sign trumpets
in white letters faber's a savannah tradition since walter of the national trust is unamused
citing the extraordinarily beautiful color of old savannah brick and the wonderful filigree of the
wrought iron he is against turning your back on what makes the place special calling
the current activist preservationist movement a reaction against urban renewal walter said if there is
anything we have learned over the last years it is that the way you build
a successful community is to make historic preservation part of the plan sign of trouble
a sign of the diminished clout of the preservationists was the construction of the hyatt
regency hotel along the savannah river earlier in the decade it is modest by many
cities standards but here its peach colored boxy architecture looms among the historic buildings built
by local developer merritt w dixon iii it stands stories high and has rooms the
promise of its substantial tax revenue as the city's largest hotel overcame bitter opposition from
the entrenched preservationist establishment but no clash over preservation values here has been more remarkable
than bud hall's it began in october when hall tried out several colors on the
queen anne style victorian home which was built in all the colors were authentic from
the victorian period hall said the other day showing a visitor a chart called victorian
hues he originally selected five colors including public house a robin's-egg blue and andover a
pink at one point he even painted his tin roof in pink stripes the savannah
historic review board pounced on hall slapping him with a stop work order arguing that
his paint job was out of character with the rest of the neighborhood sof f
f t said hall derisively they wanted colors that were sof f f t well
the victorians were not soft they were extremely eclectic they were whimsical the dispute escalated
with hall getting hauled into court and fined last year he had an artist paint
women on plywood panels asserting that the panels were an energy saving measure for his
windows preservationists and some of hall's neighbors hate the panels but they remain on the
windows the windows are not a typical treatment for that style house said reiter in
unaffected understatement it looks like stained glass the house's notoriety has earned it a stop
on the tour-bus route and sometimes the guide toots her horn at hall whose home
is known as house of many colors hall now talks of bigger battles with city
hall i want economic change in this community he said asserting that the preservation establishment
should be joining him and others in that struggle instead of mounting a paint patrol
we realize we need to attract business said reiter but she argued that in trying
to curb hall's eclecticism she was trying to prevent bit by bit piece by piece
the unraveling of the historic district preservation and economic progress are not mutually exclusive reiter
said but despite three decades of effort preservationists have been unable to energize much of
this city's commercial district most notably broughton street and an ailing city market in the
middle of the historic area in one recent study titled is savannah growing senile a
group of business and civic leaders calling itself renaissance savannah spared almost none of establishment
savannah criticizing business political and media leaders the report places the city ninth on a
list of southeastern cities in population growth behind orlando fla montgomery ala and augusta ga
the report likens savannah to an underdeveloped country said julie smith a member of the
group and a chatham county commissioner the only industry that is growing is tourism we
need to get the city moving again we've had a lot of surveys a lot
of talking a lot of writing and not a damned bit of action said one
longtime business owner here it is debatable how much of this restiveness can be blamed
on preservationists blocking progress and discouraging people from coming here but reiter acknowledges that we're
the target right now preservation is a wonderful focal point bud hall is doing all
he can to keep it that way although he says he has gone broke fighting
city hall he said that after his many appearances in court filing appeals and paying
legal fees he has been forced to file bankruptcy lawyers aren't cheap he said estimating
that his expenses have run into the thousands of dollars nevertheless hall seems to relish
his role as savannah iconoclast i'm amused by the whole thing he said i don't
know what i'll do next

issue of japanese racism grows with immigration
$BODY
january monday home edition words a chance encounter on a suburban train one recent sunday
sheds some awkward light on the elusive problem of racism in japan it began when
a little japanese girl pointed with fascination at a black woman and asked daddy what's
that the father squirmed with embarrassment he tried to satisfy the innocent curiosity of his
preschool daughter by reminding her of an old chinese fable known in japan as saiyuki
the man prodded the child with the name songoku hero of the tale which is
popular among children songoku is a monkey the young black woman apparently did not understand
enough japanese to catch the indignity of this literary allusion but she grasped the meaning
of the child's blunt question i'm a person she told the little girl in japanese
just like you a tense situation dissolved into gushing smiles of international goodwill when it
was further established that the woman was an american the child was told she herself
is a japanese and that was why they were different after her new friends got
off the train the woman confided to another american that she felt more irritated than
insulted it's the same whether they're or years old they stare and point said the
woman who had been in japan about a year teaching english japanese are all children
when it comes to dealing with other races the incident was isolated and does not
reflect how most japanese feel about people of other ethnic backgrounds but it offers a
clue as to where some disturbing misunderstandings begin furor has periodically erupted in the american
black community over the last several years at news that japanese political leaders have made
disparaging remarks about blacks in public former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone for instance drew heat
in for saying america has a low intelligence level because of its black and hispanic
minorities a japanese toy company sanrio inc was denounced and forced to withdraw its hot-selling
line of little black sambo dolls and beachwear last year after press reports described how
these caricatures with their thick lips and distorted features were regarded here as cute rather
than offensive japan's insensitivity in matters of race does not end with negative black stereotypes
a recent boom in anti semitic books has continued without serious challenge from japanese intellectuals
members of japan's ethnic korean minority mostly descendants of forced laborers brought here during the
colonial period still face discrimination in employment and marriage and only lately have felt comfortable
using their legal korean names now stubborn attitudes of racial intolerance and xenophobia are bearing
down upon the tens of thousands of asians who have come to japan often staying
illegally to seek jobs at the lower echelons of this robust economy while small scale
employers desperately need unskilled workers to correct a labor shortage many japanese oppose opening their
borders for fear of increased crime and social disorder last month a local newspaper disclosed
the existence of an internal police report that singled out pakistanis for contempt characterizing them
as smelly people with skin diseases who speak poor english get mad when they are
fed pork without being told and tend to lie in the name of allah during
interrogation it is absolutely necessary to wash your hands after questioning or detaining pakistani suspects
because many of them suffer from contagious skin diseases said the document a partial copy
of which was obtained by the times since they have a unique body odor the
detention and interrogation rooms will stink police officials have apologized to the pakistani embassy and
said they will revise the 179-page report which was distributed in november to regional authorities
by the national police agency's international research and training institute for investigation the intent of
the report was to raise awareness about people of an unfamiliar culture but it was
badly worded said masahiro tamura a senior superintendent in the agency's international criminal affairs division
there's been a sudden rise in crime by foreign visitors but we know so little
about other countries especially pakistan tamura said we thought it would be a good idea
to say a few things about what kind of country it is and give a
few examples nationwide arrests of pakistanis increased by more than five times since to cases
in as many as chinese and taiwanese were arrested last year but they were not
mentioned in the agency's training manual police are not the only ones with a low
regard for pakistanis whose relatively dark skin makes them stand out among other asian visitors
drawn to japan by the high yen and plentiful work the mayor of kawaguchi an
industrial city in saitama prefecture state with a large population of foreign workers complained to
a symposium on immigrant labor earlier this month that some pakistanis embarrass staff at public
bath houses because they do not remove their underwear when bathing according to kyodo news
service mayor yoji nagase also reportedly quipped that japanese people could bump into pakistanis at
night because of their dark skin nagase later insisted his remarks did not imply racial
prejudice in september authorities at warabi high school also in saitama barred a 19-year-old pakistani
from working as a teacher's aide in an english class school officials told the mainichi
newspaper that the man was a suspicious person and that there are a lot of
communicable diseases and crime among pakistanis similar bias is encountered by workers from bangladesh who
like those from pakistan were able to come to japan as tourists without visas until
tokyo tightened its immigration rules in april a new law will soon require foreigners to
produce certification of visa status before they can work employers will be face penalties for
hiring illegal aliens the japanese consider themselves a single race and they think their society
will become dirty if foreigners come in said a bangladeshi businessman who has lived here
for years and who asked not be identified by name to avoid antagonizing his japanese
friends this attitude is deep in their hearts there's no proof of it but if
you talk to people you're made to understand paradoxically japanese have considered themselves victims of
racial discrimination for decades and not entirely without cause japanese and chinese immigrants were deprived
of civil rights in the united states earlier this century during the regrettable era of
yellow peril and a generation of japanese americans was confined to u s concentration camps
after the attack on pearl harbor in a sense of persecution weighed heavily in japan's
decision to go to war with the united states and its territorial conquests were rationalized
as an attempt to liberate the region from western colonial masters that view remains current
among the powerful right wing of the political leadership as illustrated last year when land
agency chief seisuke okuno was forced to resign his cabinet post after declaring that japan
had justifiably fought against asian colonization by the white race even now defenders of japan's
whaling industry routinely attack environmental critics as racially motivated and some observers see the specter
of racism lurking behind the emotional backlash by some americans against the recent surge of
japanese investment in the united states they point out that there are few complaints about
corporate takeovers by the british one hawkish lawmaker shintaro ishihara rattled nerves in washington earlier
this year by asserting in a book of essays that racism is at the base
of u s japan trade friction yet despite this apparent gulf in communication the japanese
have attempted to repair damaged feelings in some of the most highly visible cases of
racial insensitivity the foreign ministry issued a memorandum to the publishing industry in september warning
of jewish revulsion toward a recent spate of japanese bestsellers that postulate zionist conspiracies behind
world events some of the books may offend the most sensitive areas of jewish psychology
the memorandum said the fact that such anti semitic works are published unchallenged and without
criticism in japan calls into question the common sense of the japanese people government and
publishing industry officials have so far responded positively to complaints partly because it's bad for
business said neil c sandberg director of the american jewish committee's pacific rim institute who
recently visited tokyo with a delegation of jewish leaders but part of it represents a
new understanding the japanese have had very limited exposure to cultural differences for many centuries
and developed a sense of uniqueness that tends to encourage either indifference or negative feelings
toward foreigners sandberg said there's a vacuum here because there's so little information about the
jews we're worried that these books may fill that void with negative stereotypes the potential
for exporting intolerance also worries sandberg who noted that the work of one of the
most scurrilous anti semitic writers masami uno has been translated into korean questions also have
been raised about employment practices of japanese companies with operations abroad earlier this year former
employees of a u s subsidiary of recruit co the job-placement firm of political bribery
scandal fame alleged that a secret code had been used to discriminate among applicants on
the basis of race and sex when a client wanted to hire a japanese or
a latino for example the names mariko or maria were allegedly jotted on internal memos
in an echo of former prime minister nakasone's slur about u s ethnic diversity a
significant number of japanese two out of five believe that america's major economic problem is
that it has too many minorities according to a recent harris poll cited in the
magazine business week there are some encouraging signs of changing attitudes however hajime arita a
10-year-old and his parents started a family campaign to fight racism in japan after reading
about the little black sambo controversy they visited washington in august to meet black leaders
and promote better understanding japanese booksellers have removed copies of the children's book little black
sambo from their shelves and several companies have joined sanrio in phasing out products and
designs featuring derogatory caricatures of blacks but the caricatures essentially borrowed from the symbols of
america's own past still proliferate on the japanese landscape in signs and advertising images one
such eyesore is the sign outside a tiny pub in tokyo's ebisu neighborhood which calls
itself chibi kuro sambo japanese for little black sambo inside is a log-cabin decor with
comical black dolls displayed on the window sill the japanese waitress has her hair set
in a style resembling african dreadlocks and wears a red gingham smock specialties on the
menu are little black fried chicken and little black potatoes owner sachiko sasaki does not
see why there is such a fuss over the theme she chose for her pub
nine years ago she has no plans to change the name this had nothing to
do with racial prejudice or how i feel about black people sasaki said i've always

aquino reshuffles cabinet but keeps ramos philippines the shake-up is unlikely to satisfy the rebels or other critics analysts say
$BODY
january monday home edition words one month after a coup nearly toppled her from power
president corazon aquino announced sweeping changes in her cabinet on sunday including a new chief
of the nation's much criticized civilian intelligence services aquino removed seven of her cabinet ministers
and moved several others to new posts it was the broadest cabinet shake-up since she
assumed power four years ago but aquino did not accede to growing pressure to oust
defense secretary fidel v ramos whose military has now mutinied six times against her government
or announce new policies to solve the nation's growing social and economic problems the cabinet
shake-up came as rebel leaders declared a cease fire for the new year's weekend ending
for the moment nearly daily rumors and press reports of another coup or assassination attempt
the dec 1-9 military revolt left at least dead and more than wounded analysts said
much of the cabinet reshuffle appeared more cosmetic than substantive they said it was unlikely
to satisfy rebel leaders and military and civilian critics who charge that aquino's administration is
corrupt and inefficient but aquino won critical support in a strongly worded pastoral letter that
was read in thousands of churches before millions of parishioners sunday morning across asia's only
roman catholic country the staging of a coup d'etat is a rebellion against god from
whom all civil authority is derived the nation's bishops declared in the letter in other
words to seize power through a coup d'etat is a sin the letter said that
the faithful could not stand idly by during a coup which it called a morally
neutral stand the church leaders led by manila's archbishop cardinal jaime sin conceded that there
is abuse of power incompetence and graft under aquino our government must get its act
together the church leaders warned calling for profound and thoroughgoing reforms in a nationally televised
appearance aquino said that she reorganized her cabinet to adjust to new situations and to
improve deteriorating government services her spokesman adolfo azcuna later told reporters that the changes were
triggered not so much by the coup attempt but by the same reasons that precipitated
the coup attempt it's something you might say is parallel azcuna said the new cabinet
should be an action team the time for action is long overdue the most significant
change appeared to be the sacking of rodolfo canieso who ran the national intelligence coordinating
authority the philippine equivalent of the cia philippine intelligence apparently failed to detect the most
recent revolt in which an estimated heavily armed rebel troops quickly captured the nation's top
military bases and then laid siege to manila's financial district in his defense canieso said
later that a majority of the armed forces did not oppose the coup before running
the intelligence agency canieso was commander of the army and head of a right wing
anti communist group under his tenure the army helped foster dozens of rural vigilante groups
who were blamed for hundreds of human rights abuses including brutal beatings and deaths canieso
was replaced with retired maj gen mariano adalem who also was named presidential consultant on
military affairs adalem had commanded the philippine army until he was appointed head of the
national casino authority in but aquino did not remove defense secretary ramos or armed forces
chief of staff renato de villa opposition politicians and even some of aquino's closest aides
had demanded that both be ousted for failing to forestall the latest military uprising ramos
was a prime target of the coup attempt and rebel leaders have made his removal
a key demand ramos helped start the initial military civilian revolt that swept aquino to
power in he has been her closest and most trusted military adviser since then and
is considered a front runner in the presidential election when her term expires alex magno
an associate professor of political science at the university of the philippines said aquino could
not replace ramos easily since he is the only civilian respected by a large segment
of the armed forces it might be unwise to make dramatic changes in the military
now magno said it's not politically feasible it might disturb a very precarious equilibrium other
analysts said that aquino's failure to remove several key aides was as noteworthy as the
shifts she made she did not for example replace jose s concepcion jr secretary of
trade and industry or mita pardo de tavera head of social welfare and development concepcion's
longtime tenure as trade czar has been marked by widespread accusations by foreign businessmen and
local officials of inefficiency incompetence and possible corruption concepcion broke into tears several months ago
while defending himself in a congressional hearing which examined allegations that his own companies had
profited from his official actions tavera who has served in the cabinet since aquino came
to power has been criticized even by aquino's inner circle for failing to deliver basic
social services in rural provinces but analysts applauded aquino's removal of education secretary lourdes quisumbing
in favor of isidro carino the highly regarded president of university of the east one
of manila's largest universities quisumbing has presided over an education system that has seen illiteracy
grow a decline in the number of schools a lack of textbooks and other major
problems aquino also won kudos for replacing transportation secretary rainerio reyes with oscar orbos one
of the philippines most active congressmen and sponsor of a bill that would boost small
business in rural areas under reyes public transportation in the capital has deteriorated dramatically in
the past year with a shortage of buses rising fares and a series of crippling
strikes aquino moved her labor secretary franklin drilon to head the justice department he replaces
sedfrey ordonez who had vowed to resign if he did not catch any big fish
in corruption or organized crime by year's end although he did not succeed ordonez was
named new ambassador to the united nations with the economy struggling to recover from the
coup's bloody fighting aquino replaced both her finance secretary and the head of the central
bank she also named a new secretary to run the land reform program which has
been plagued by scandal and charges that the aquino family sugar cane plantation used a
loophole to avoid distributing land aquino also appointed new secretaries for agriculture economic planning labor

january monday valley edition words among other items on his sweeping legislative agenda rep henry
a waxman d-los angeles aspires to overhaul the clean air act and place stricter limits
on agricultural pesticide residue on fruits and vegetables he also hopes to require food manufacturers
to provide detailed labeling of products and scientific support for health claims rep howard l
berman d-panorama city meanwhile is seeking immigration reform that would increase the number of visas
for family members of permanent u s residents he is also sponsoring a bill to
ban black boxes which are used to make unauthorized copies of videocassettes among his modest
legislative goals rep elton gallegly r-simi valley continues to carry a measure that would empower
federal courts to impose the death sentence for the killing of federal law enforcement officers
the same proposal failed to move in the last session of congress these six measures
are a sampling of the diverse bills that the five san fernando valley area members
introduced this year and hope to see enacted in the proposals generally deal with national
issues rather than local concerns nonetheless some of the laws such as the clean air
act immigration reform videocassette copyright protection and waxman's efforts to provide early confidential aids testing
and counseling are of particular interest to southern californians obviously these health issues have impact
on my constituents as they have on people throughout the country said waxman whose 24th
district includes universal city and parts of north hollywood and los feliz as well as
the beverly fairfax area hollywood and hancock park the initiatives carried in the 101st congress
by waxman berman gallegly and by reps anthony c beilenson d-los angeles and carlos j
moorhead r-glendale reflect the lawmakers legislative priorities as well as their place in the capitol
hill hierarchy waxman expects to pass some of his far-reaching bills although struggles remain over
important specifics berman may see provisions of his immigration bill incorporated into a broad reform
package and would like to move other proposals and beilenson hopes that his politically risky
measures in favor of a tax increase and public campaign financing will at least inspire
discussion moorhead and gallegly as members of the republican minority face uphill battles over their
narrower legislative priorities the valley members initiatives are among measures introduced by house members in
the first year of the two-year session overall bills and resolutions have been enacted which
is typical of an institution that tends to creep along until adjournment approaches and then
engages in a lawmaking frenzy even then most proposals fail to negotiate the legislative labyrinth
success often comes by folding the provisions of a bill into a broader measure that
appears headed for passage persuading senior colleagues to sponsor an initiative or influencing behind-the-scenes negotiations
and policy committee actions for republicans such as moorhead this may mean getting a democrat
to adopt their ideas and it often takes more than one session of congress to
get something done thus many of the valley area lawmakers proposals are carried over from
previous sessions when they failed to go anywhere for the third time for instance beilenson
is sponsoring a bill to increase the federal gasoline tax by cents a gallon over
a five year period to reduce the federal deficit and another to publicly finance congressional
general election campaigns for the fourth time he has reintroduced a measure to double the
safety standard for automobile bumpers they're the sort of thing he likes to leave there
so people will talk about it said a legislative aide to beilenson after two unsuccessful
attempts to expand patent protection for industrial designs of such items as luggage telephones and
automobile parts moorhead says that new-found backing by key colleagues and the bush administration may
portend passage i think we will get it through eventually moorhead said last week i
wouldn't guarantee this congress we're building more and more support for it all the time
waxman a legislative power as chairman of the influential health and environment subcommittee of the
house energy and commerce committee is carrying numerous major bills and plans to introduce others
in addition to the clean air food labeling pesticide and aids measures he is pushing
bills to establish standards and routine inspections of fish to detect chemical contamination toughen the
food and drug administration's oversight of medical devices increase the number of community residential programs
for the mentally retarded and authorize medicaid to pay for home health care for the
poor elderly rather than restricting coverage to nursing home costs waxman said last week that
he also plans to sponsor a bill to further restrict cigarette promotion and advertising and
sale to minors stiff opposition from the powerful tobacco lobby is expected this is not
unusual on many of his initiatives waxman is opposed by the bush administration as well
as by private industry a senior agriculture official testified in may that waxman's bill to
change the standard for cancer causing carcinogenic pesticide residue on food from a balancing of
health and economic concerns to strictly health considerations would have a disastrous impact on food
prices and the food supply the measure is one of several introduced in the wake
of widespread fears prompted by use of the chemical alar on apples waxman in turn
adamantly opposes a pesticide control bill by the white house that would tighten registration requirements
and stiffen sanctions against violators but would also prevent states from imposing more stringent pesticide
restrictions environmentalists in california are seeking to place a tough environmental initiative on the ballot
that would phase out all agricultural chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive injury by
waxman's subcommittee chairmanship has allowed him to assemble a large and respected staff hold frequent
hearings and aggressively pursue a liberal agenda that includes protecting consumers and fighting for benefits
for the poor elderly and infirm he possesses an instinct for the legislative process that
is second to none a thorough knowledge of the rules and willingness to exploit every
one and a temperament that is all but unflappable said the edition of the american
almanac of politics berman an ally of waxman's has established clout on the house judiciary
committee particularly on immigration and copyright issues as a member of the foreign affairs committee
he also has become a player on some international matters this year berman passed a
far-reaching bill that prohibits all arms sales whether publicly known or covert to countries placed
on a so-called terrorist list by the secretary of state unless the president provides congress
with prior notice and detailed justification berman introduced the measure in response to the iran
arms sales scandal in an effort to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles he also
has sponsored a bill to require the president to impose sanctions against companies that export
missile technology in violation of u s export control laws under the measure which overwhelmingly
passed the house this year foreign companies that sell this technology to countries such as
libya or iraq would face the prospect of being cut off from u s department
of defense contracts on immigration as congress moves to revise the 24-year-old u s visa
allotment system berman is pushing for expansion of visas in general and is championing the
reunification of family members of those who have become permanent u s residents berman maintains
this should remain the cornerstone of national immigration policy others however have sought to shift
the overall emphasis toward immigrants education and employment skills this is intended to open the
doors for more western europeans who have been largely shut out by the current system's
bias toward regions with more recent immigrants who thus have more immediate relatives in the
united states these regions include parts of asia and latin america berman is also carrying
a bill that he has previously introduced twice the measure sought by the american civil
liberties union would remove the president's authority to prohibit u s citizens from spending money
in countries against which the united states has an economic embargo which effectively prohibits travel
to places such as cuba vietnam and north korea berman passed a provision of his
original bill last year that eliminated the ban on exporting and importing informational materials such
as films newspapers and books to and from embargoed countries beilenson's significant legislative roles are
by their very nature low profile he sits on the important but largely anonymous house
rules committee which controls the flow of legislation and determines the limits of debate on
the house floor he is chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence which
provides oversight and approves the budgets for the cia and other intelligence agencies beilenson tends
to be less of a force on other legislation his tax and consumer bills have
languished his proposals to publicly finance congressional campaigns have earned him renown as an advocate
but have not led to any reform yet nevertheless such efforts have contributed to beilenson's
reputation as an independent minded lawmaker willing to take politically unpalatable positions that are certain
to wind up in election opponents brochures beilenson did win passage last year of a
long sought measure prohibiting the import of ivory and other pachyderm parts as part of
international efforts to save the threatened african elephant under the measure congress can earmark as
much as million a year for elephant conservation projects was appropriated last year beilenson plans
to ask for million again in the fiscal year an aide said but funding remains
uncertain gallegly a two-term republican has yet to make a legislative mark none of the
handful of bills he sponsored in his three years has passed this year he picked
up additional bipartisan support for his measure to authorize the death penalty for killers of
police judges and other law enforcement officials similar bills had previously stalled in committees but
gallegly maintained his was more narrowly drawn he also sponsored a bill to deny federal
student financial aid to individuals convicted of desecrating the american flag it remains in the
house committee on education and labor he concentrated more of his attention to constituent service
and building relationships with other members and familiarizing himself with the process john frith gallegly's
spokesman said of the former simi valley mayor's first term now frith said gallegly's staff
is exploring a series of legislative initiatives that may be introduced next year these include
a resolution putting congress on record as opposing any consideration of legalizing drugs and bills
to ban the manufacture sale and importation of drug paraphernalia to shift american troops no
longer needed in europe to immigration and naturalization border patrols and to give the president
a line item budget veto but allow congress to override a presidential veto with a
majority vote moorhead dean of the california republican delegation has introduced a measure to require
customs agents to check the vehicle identification number of exported automobiles he said this would
cut down on car thefts that involve changing identification numbers and shipping stolen vehicles overseas
another moorhead measure would permit the ins to use volunteers for clerical and secretarial duties
at border patrol offices this idea which moorhead said was prompted by volunteer programs in
los angeles law-enforcement agencies is intended to alleviate a manpower shortage by putting more professional
agents out on patrol neither bill has gained any apparent legislative momentum in addition to
his design patents proposal moorhead also has introduced a bill to provide a process for
patenting products developed through space exploration he said he is optimistic about its prospects beyond
his own bills moorhead said he is often involved in shaping legislation as the ranking
republican on energy and commerce's subcommittee on energy and power and on judiciary's subcommittee on
courts civil liberties and administration of justice the latter assignment has led to his pre-eminent

firefighters by fireplaces remodel new agua dulce firehouse began life as family home
$BODY
january monday valley edition words firefighters assigned to los angeles county fire station in remote
agua dulce find they can do most of their work from home the home in
this case is the station itself a converted three bedroom ranch style house on sierra
highway that serves a 60-square-mile area with a population of about it houses two firefighters
a fire department engineer and a captain each of whom spends an average of two
24-hour shifts per week in the cozy quarters the 200-square-foot house was bought by the
county in to replace the community's aging fire station in nearby mint canyon fire department
officials said it is one of only three such stations operated by the county the
others are on catalina island and in the city of walnut said randy gomez construction
coordinator for the fire department two other county fire stations operate out of mobile homes
he said the house cost the county about a third of what it might have
cost to build a new station officials said the fire department spent an additional to
remodel the house it's a nice change from the standard red-brick station providing relaxation amid
otherwise stressful working conditions firefighters say on a comfort scale of one to this is
a said fire engineer allyn holton who regularly works at a much busier county fire
station in newhall but occasionally fills in at station when its engineer has to be
away it's more like a motel instead of an army barracks fire department planners built
an office for the captain and installed a larger entrance a microphone and loudspeakers for
radio dispatches and a paper towel dispenser in the bathroom but in most respects the
single story house looks pretty much the way it did in its domestic state said
capt ted lindaman one of three captains assigned to the station firefighters enjoy the luxury
of two fireplaces a bathtub and a large kitchen with wood grain cabinets and a
built-in microwave oven they pitched in for a large screen television in the living room
and each bedroom has weightlifting equipment for fitness training an outdoor satellite dish that came
with the house improves tv reception in the mountainous area lindaman said there isn't much
interior decorating to speak of the walls are generally bare except for a large map
showing county fire station locations and family mementos have been replaced by a firefighter's first
place award for a local chili cook-off and a wood plaque that says the fighting
81st the captain and engineer have their own bedrooms and the two firefighters share the
third bedroom a total of fire department employees are assigned to the station though only
four occupy the house at any one time due to shift changes lindaman said the
house caught the eye of fire department planners because its garage had been built to
fit the previous owner's motor home and was large enough for a fire engine lindaman
said also a large corrugated metal storage shed has room for four reserve engines that
can be put into service throughout the area if regular engines are being repaired he
said most of the station's calls are for auto accidents on sierra highway an alternate
route to the often congested antelope valley freeway and occasional brush fires in between firefighters
inspect water tanks for leaks and make sure that brush has been cleared near homes
and businesses lindaman said the station handled about calls this year compared with about at
station in newhall officials said the homey atmosphere is nice for some but others prefer
a faster pace lindaman said this is a nice station to be at he said
but if you're looking for a lot of action you want to get out of
here this is not what you would call a fast firehouse and despite the remodeling
some of the fixtures just aren't designed for the kind of wear and tear that
fire stations have to endure lindaman said at most stations doors are designed to swing
so firefighters can quickly exit to respond to emergencies but the solid wood doors at
station sometimes lock when closed creating hassles when firefighters rush out of the house toward
the fire engine lindaman said it has its advantages and disadvantages he said this tends
to alleviate some of the stress because of the atmosphere but it's not really set
up to be a firehouse the fixtures are meant for a regular family they're not
meant for guys day in and day out going in and out you have firefighters
who are dirty and grimy coming back from fires and the carpet has a tendency
to get dirty visitors to the station are surprised to find out it's a house
lindaman said people that stop in say boy this is pretty nice just like being
at home he said well it is in a way people have never seen a
fire station like it

rams have the last word 21-7 nfc playoffs l a offense scores on first two possessions and all-zone defense shuts down cunningham and eagles

january monday home edition words no one ever said buddy ryan's team couldn't talk like
coach like team the philadelphia eagles passed out opinions last week like business cards zone
defense if the rams were sissies enough to try it fine it's their reputations on
the line down at the rifle club the eagles defensive line couldn't be stopped they'd
swat the rams from their path like moths from a doorstep super bowl here we
come travel plans if needed the eagles would be sunning in santa rosa this week
in preparation for next week's divisional playoff game against san francisco they can go ahead
and plan that flight to frisco ram quarterback jim everett said but they ain't going
not representing the league anyway the rams ruined some great pregame material for round two
with a 21-7 wild card victory over the eagles at veterans stadium on sunday earning
a spot in next week's divisional game against the new york giants in the meadowlands
not much to talk about really the rams scored two touchdowns in the first eight
minutes could have scored two more in the next eight but didn't then held on
in typical hair raising fashion needing two greg bell bursts in the final five minutes
to clinch it over ryan's protestations about the sins of zone defense the rams proceeded
with their coverage of eagle quarterback randall cunningham he was to them a blip on
their radar screen never to be lost from tracking unsporting as it seemed the rams
played not a single down of man-to-man defense against the eagles theirs was more a
quarantine approach of patience and containment and it worked well enough to hold cunningham to
rushing yards and no touchdowns ryan said last week that any quarterback worth his salt
could undress a zone sunday he could only tip his cap to ram defensive coordinator
fritz shurmur who had caged cunningham with nets not bullets on this subject you might
say shurmur and ryan another defensive strategist have differing opinions i disagree like hell with
it shurmur said of ryan's attack philosophy physical is not described in terms of man-to-man
or pass rush our guys are as tough as any group i've been around these
guys have been criticized chastised people have said what's a defense that's 21st in the
league doing in the playoffs all of those things i think this was a great
opportunity for them to show the world that hey we can play this game however
you want to play it on the flip side of scrimmage the rams offensive line
kept the heat off everett the eagles sack team of reggie white and jerome brown
bagged everett one time each but it wasn't the menacing rush of doom that had
been predicted tackle jackie slater said the line has never been better prepared and worked
in uncommon unison to pick up stunts and blitzes the line held the eagles in
check without holding any eagles the lone ram penalty in the game in fact was
a self induced delay call to proffer a better end-zone angle for punter dale hatcher
ram coach john robinson considered his line's work commendable given the task at hand their
line is very famous he said mockingly of the eagles front four but they clearly
had their hands full with our offensive line you might call it a standoff you
might call it that robinson wasn't you get to vote he said but i thought
we won they said they were going to win the battle i don't think they
did the eagles arrogance born of their coach rubbed many rams the wrong way even
the team's most guarded diplomat everett admitted he took some of last week's eagle chatter
into the huddle greg bell said he was taunted throughout the game by eagles safety
andre waters who jarred the ball from bell's arms on a first down carry at
the eagles five in the first quarter a crucial fumble considering the rams could have
moved ahead 21-0 with a touchdown he just talked the whole game bell said of
waters it got to be kind of funny he kept saying four-two bell's number i'm
going to get you and he got me bell redeemed himself later with the rams
clinging to a seven point lead in the fourth quarter pinned at their own with
left the rams craved a possession drive to work time off the clock they kept
the drive alive on third and four at their on a 15-yard pass from everett
to buford mcgee on second down from the bell took a handoff and broke the
play outside bell sometimes they spend too much time thinking about what to say and
they don't think about what their assignments are bell broke free down the left sideline
and ran yards before being dragged down by izel jenkins at the i don't think
i was flying down the field as fast as bo jackson would bell said but
i was getting down the field i knew he was back there because i'd seen
him when i took off he wasted a lot of time trying to strip me
of the ball rather than trip me up jenkins did strip the ball but bell
was able grab the ball with his other hand before going down bell ran three
yards on first down and then scored the game clincher from seven yards out with
left putting the rams up 21-7 he couldn't top last week's 210-yard performance against new
england but this wasn't the patriots defense either bell finished with yards in carries which
was plenty good enough for robinson greg bell had an outstanding game robinson said that
was a slippery wet treacherous set of circumstances bell said the eagles a gambling defense
by nature gambled one time too many on his long run he said it was
only a matter of time before a big play popped i knew our line was
more dominant than theirs because they were trying so many stunts he said if a
team stunts a lot it tells you one thing they can't beat you straight so
they've got to try and finesse their way and they weren't capable of doing it
so ram fans live to suffer another day the rams dominated the eagles throughout but
still needed a fourth quarter surge to protect the win robinson was almost indignant when
asked how such a thing could happen this is the way this team has played
all year he said we screw up that's us it took the rams five plays
to score on their first possession everett throwing a wobbly underthrown pass to receiver henry
ellard who was rewarded for jumping higher than safety jenkins by pulling down the reception
at about the and strolling in for a 39-yard touchdown pass play after a 30-yard
eagles punt on their first possession the rams marched yards in seven plays for another
touchdown the score coming on a four yard pass from everett to damone johnson the
rams might have been cruising at halftime if not for bell's fumble inside the five
a 47-yard field goal attempt by mike lansford that went awry and an everett interception
late in the half after the rams had earned first-and-10 at the eagles the unenlightened
might see the squandering of such opportunities as wasteful or nerve wracking we have character
tackle irv pankey said we don't put up a facade of character you see what
i'm saying we've got character with sunday's win the rams also have a chance and
a funny feeling it's growing on us everett said it's like the rams can get

analysis rams got defensive about it
$BODY
january monday home edition words the poor guy was just trying to do his job
revving up a grounds crew truck outside the ram locker room and there was john
robinson's red face screaming at him either move it in or move it out robinson
yelled at the driver we can't get anything done with that going upon command the
rumbling truck shifted into reverse and retreated around the corner out of earshot giving robinson
the space he needed to conduct his postgame rap session the coach looked pleased yeah
he said puffing out his chest we're tough guys if you thought the rams were
defensive during sunday's 21-7 wild card victory over philadelphia you should have heard them in
the aftermath under ram horns sits some extremely thin skin along with ears that burned
all week on both coasts this is what the rams heard or what they thought
they heard a they're too soft b they can't play in the cold c they
can't play in the playoffs d they can't play a lick of defense robinson swears
he heard it people are always on us we don't play enough man-to-man we don't
rush the passer we're stupid we don't know how to coach he said quarterback jim
everett swears he heard it how many shows did i watch in philadelphia talking about
the eagles going to san francisco he said linebacker kevin greene swears he heard it
we read stuff about the warm weather the beach boys from l a he said
and i don't like it basically it took three philadelphia quotes to set the rams
off the first had eagle coach buddy ryan calling the ram defense the worst in
the playoffs true but unkind the second also came from ryan claiming the eagles were
good enough to beat the 49ers which presumed the eagles already had the rams beaten
the third came from mike schad the ram washout who now starts for philadelphia schad
forecast an eagle victory because the rams weren't physical enough up front and basically were
about to get head butted all over veterans stadium we heard all of it everett
said we took a lot of pregame abuse that comes with the territory i guess
when you play philly and buddy ryan they gave us a lot of motivation we
had the locker room material they gave it to us that's the way they play
that's fine they deserved everything they got today so sunday was a day for the
rams to break a few myths although as with most stereotypes some of them were
grounded in fact fact before sunday the rams were 2-5 in playoff games this decade
robinson's only postseason victories had come against the dallas cowboys in and fact before sunday
the rams were winless in cold weather playoff sites this decade losing twice at washington
and again at chicago in the nfc championship game fact the rams defense did rank
21st in the nfl this season a dead last 28th against the pass consider ram
cornerback leroy irvin a fact checker look at the standings look at the ratings irvin
said we do have the worst defense in the playoffs no doubt about it and
the worst defense in the playoffs holds randall cunningham to seven points not bad for
a bunch of hacks irvin noted irvin wasn't however as ready to support the cold-war
theory they said we couldn't win in the cold why irvin said because we lost
to chicago when they were the most dominant team in the entire league i don't
know how they can say that i'm from kansas mel owens is from michigan vince
newsome is from washington we've got guys who've played in cold weather their entire college
careers including running back greg bell late of notre dame and the buffalo bills who
gets downright indignant over the topic people are always writing we have trouble with the
cold weather bell said that's nothing new i've been written off for the last six
years i've been out of the league for six years i'm still reading that i'm
a malingerer although i don't see it and john robinson doesn't see it i didn't
see us blinking in the cold weather today but that won't change what people write
about us it's amazing the rams moved as well as they did in the pennsylvania
rain considering the persecution complex they carried with them but whatever gets you through the
wild card round if rams had to believe that the world was out to get
them in order to band together against the eagles then fine there may be a
future in paranoid power after all if everett found the going a little too slippery
when wet he was intercepted twice the ram defense and offensive line performed at peak
capacity when philadelphia had the football the rams yielded but three first downs in the
first half sacked cunningham twice and held the eagles scoreless through three quarters when the
rams had the ball the hard rushing philadelphia front was neutralized resulting in net ram
yards sleet or no sleet we physically controlled the football game said robinson delighting in
each syllable their defensive line is to be congratulated they're famous i don't want to
call it a standoff but we controlled the line of scrimmage their defensive line clearly
had their hands full or as everett gleefully pointed out we might live close to

steelers give oilers the boot in overtime
$BODY
january monday home edition words it began as a comedy of errors and although both
teams played minutes of pretty good football in the fourth quarter it ended with another
big error in overtime a fumble that led the pittsburgh steelers to a 26-23 upset
victory over the houston oilers sunday at the astrodome in the first half houston halfback
lorenzo white fumbled a kickoff in the end zone before picking the ball up and
running it out to the five yard line this is a mistake that few high
school backs make in overtime on the oilers first play after the steelers had won
the toss but failed to make a first down white fumbled again this time pittsburgh
got it on the oiler made one first down then called in gary anderson to
kick the seventh 50-yard field goal of his career for the winning points of the
day's second nfl wild card game it was his fourth field goal of a ragged
sometimes badly played game that was full of dropped passes mishandled punts false starts and
wasted big plays anderson's kicking however was errorless putting the steelers in denver for next
weekend's second round match with the favored broncos it can go unsaid that our football
team is on the way up pittsburgh coach chuck noll said afterward playoff time is
fun time that's what you work for all year houston coach jerry glanville who usually
has a lot to say said there really isn't much to say anderson's big kick
put glanville's team away despite a strong comeback performance by oiler quarterback warren moon who
took charge in the fourth period after pittsburgh had led after the first minutes 7-0
at halftime 10-6 and after one series of the fourth period 16-9 at that point
after the oilers had made only one first down in the third quarter moon finally
got them moving with two impressive drives ending in touchdown passes to wide receiver ernest
givins and now after slumbering most of the afternoon houston was ahead 23-16 it didn't
last as a crowd of houston partisans swept the steelers with noisy jeers they marched
yards to get even in regulation time 23-23 before winning it in the fifth minute
of overtime pittsburgh quarterback bubby brister was the triggerman for the steelers on the two
touchdown drives they managed in the midst of anderson's kicking exhibition an exhibition in which
he improved steadily as the day wore on with field goals of and yards moreover
brister's poise in only his second season as a starter was eventually the difference but
it was the coaching of noll that made everything possible for the steelers who moved
to their first touchdown with well rehearsed old-fashioned plays a statue of liberty run and
a quick pitch end run both by rookie running back tim worley in the opening
minutes after the steelers blocked houston's first punt at the oiler noll's first call was
the statue which produced yards his last call was the pitch to worley for the
nine yard touchdown in the old days the nfl's better teams often relied on the
quick pitch which requires a big fast back with the moves to cut around the
defensive line without any help from pulling blockers noll who has been around awhile brought
it back at the right time and place and worley made it go as well
as bobby mitchell used to for cleveland when browns opponents were keying on jim brown
the game tying pittsburgh touchdown drive in the fourth quarter was another noll masterpiece at
all times he made sure to keep the pressure off brister who was asked to
throw nothing longer than yards and who was assisted at a timely moment by an
end-around run by wide receiver dwight stone gaining yards to the houston from there the
steelers hammered in the tying touchdown on six runs by their big backs worley and
merril hoge through a houston line that had been devastated by injuries by then three
of the oilers most useful defensive linemen ray childress doug smith and richard byrd were
all out noll's most successful call on that last drive the one that probably won
him the game was hoge's nine yard draw play to the one-yard line and so
a sharp old nfl coach noll combined with some sharp new steelers brister worley hoge
and tight end mike mularkey among others to end another dream for houston coach glanville
to most of the watching in the oldest of the domed stadiums glanville appeared to
have brought in the better offensive players moon givins wide receiver drew hill and four
rotating backs the best of whom is halfback allen pinkett but as an offensive team
the problem with the oilers is that their running offense is based on power and
their pass offense on the run-and-shoot you can usually tell what they're going to do
by the way they line up when their four little receivers are on the field
it's hard for them to fake a pass and succeed with a power run conversely
they don't effectively pass after faking a run good football teams normally run to set
up the pass as washington and even san francisco often do or they pass to
set up the run as detroit does in its run-and-shoot offense but the oilers don't
do either and in the overtime period after their defensive team had stopped pittsburgh at
the outset glanville had to make a decision should he send in the pass offense
race horses or the power backs after thinking it over a moment he called for
the power but on first down he gave the ball to white an east west
runner with some moves who often fails to cut forward at the appropriate time on
the biggest play of the game he was still sliding laterally when cornerback rod woodson
came up and separated him from the ball when white fumbled the new year's party
was almost over for the oilers on pittsburgh's first play after recovering the fumble noll
went back to his trap blocking offense he is one of the few favoring this
style of attack as an everyday staple and got yards from hoge that was enough
for anderson

after years of winning hatfield worried about the wording cotton bowl arkansas coach fussing over contract before facing tennessee in second consecutive trip to dallas
$BODY
january monday home edition words in six seasons as head football coach at the university
of arkansas his alma mater ken hatfield has compiled a record of 55-16-1 the best
winning percentage of any coach in school history what's more he has survived the 80s
without the taint of ncaa probation which given the state of the southwest conference during
the last decade is practically a man bites dog story lou holtz hatfield's predecessor at
arkansas took the razorbacks to six different bowl games during his seven years at the
school but never got them to the cotton bowl today under hatfield the 10th ranked
razorbacks 10-1 will make their second consecutive cotton bowl appearance meeting eighth ranked tennessee 10-1
the game marks the first time arkansas has appeared in back-to-back cotton bowls since 1965-66
but even with these accomplishments hatfield doesn't rest easy and a new contract offered to
him a year ago remains on his desk in fayetteville ark unsigned there are a
couple of little wording things in there that i don't think are right he said
and i'm not going to sign it as long as they're wrong it's a difference
of opinion at this point we have not resolved it but i love arkansas it's
my state we've won there we're recruiting well there but will they love him tomorrow
when hatfield replaced holtz ousted after a 6-5 season the move was hailed as a
native son returning to his roots hatfield coming off a five year run as head
coach at air force had grown up in helena ark and played defensive back for
the razorbacks his 81-yard punt return for a touchdown helped arkansas beat texas 14-13 in
the year the razorbacks went 11-0 and won the national championship razorback fans weary of
holtz's jokes and excuses were ready for the change it wasn't long however before the
school's fickle following turned on hatfield his offense a wishbone derivative known as the flexbone
was roundly knocked for being unimaginative and boring hatfield's personal style also drew criticism he
was said to be too preachy too open with his religious beliefs the anti hatfield
sentiment reached a crescendo in when the razorbacks picked to win the swc finished tied
for second and as that season wound down arkansas athletic director frank broyles the man
who had coached hatfield and then hired him years later joined the chorus saying publicly
that hatfield needed to open up personally be more willing to explain his actions to
arkansas fans and open up his offense as well under these pressurized conditions the razorbacks
won the swc championship outright and earned the school's first cotton bowl trip in years
at the end of that season hatfield was offered a new contract but he declined
to sign it there was speculation before arkansas cotton bowl meeting with ucla that hatfield
was headed for georgia to replace the retiring vince dooley hatfield did not dispel that
speculation then later said the talk linking him to the job was enough of a
distraction to contribute to his team's 17-3 loss to the bruins said broyles as a
reward for a great season he got a new five year contract a big raise
and raises for his coaches i did that way before the cotton bowl then he
looks at it and he wants a big well his lawyer wants a big definitive
contract rather than just what faculty and holtz and former arkansas basketball coach eddie sutton
and broyles and others had so we write up a big definitive contract for him
definitive meaning everything a lawyer can think of broyles said thirteen pages broyles says he
is totally confident with hatfield in charge of the football program although they are not
close personally said broyles we have nothing in common off the field because he does
certain things like well i play golf he plays tennis and other things when i'm
not at the office or at home i'm playing golf but i don't think i
would want to be personal friends with the people who work under me as a
rule i just don't think that's wise but ken and i are professional friends hatfield
on broyles my relationship with him is something that's been different ever since i've been
back at the university of arkansas but hey he's doing a good job as an
athletic director he's doing a tremendous job still it's plain that these two are on
different pages philosophically according to broyles a college football coach nowadays has to do more
than simply win he must win with the sort of flair that will keep the
stadium full and the contributions flowing said broyles the day lou holtz walked in i
said you've got to sell out the stadium do whatever it takes to sell out
the stadium and he did he knew that i think any coach knows that hatfield
may know it but he doesn't buy into it he did dump his flexbone this
season in favor of the i-formation but hatfield remains a ground oriented coach the razorbacks
actually threw the ball less in than they did in hatfield on offense too many
of the commentators doing football on television are pro-oriented or come from the pro ranks
they think you've got to throw the ball every down the game is changing a
little bit but the media people have made it like if you don't pass you're
no good a fullback who carries the ball is not thought of as highly as
a receiver who makes a splashy spectacular catch and yet i love that fullback who's
got a momma and daddy just like everybody else so what does ken hatfield want
i don't know yet he said i mean i know what i want but that's
something that the administration myself and so forth are going to have to talk about

nebraska's gdowski impresses the people who count the most fiesta bowl cornhusker quarterback the coaches choice leads team against florida state
$BODY
january monday home edition words unlike florida state's peter tom willis his lankier counterpart in
today's fiesta bowl game nebraska quarterback gerry gdowski probably won't attract much attention from nfl
scouts a year from now the 6-foot 190-pound academic all-american might well be back home
in fremont neb balancing books as an accountant like willis though gdowski will look back
fondly on a senior season in which he was nothing short of spectacular in his
only chance to be a collegiate starter putting up the kind of numbers that made
fans and the media wonder where he had been hiding for three years according to
his coach tom osborne no nebraska quarterback has ever played the position any better than
gdowski and yet he remains almost as unknown as he was last august an understudy
for two years behind all-big eight quarterback steve taylor a three year starter for the
cornhuskers gdowski emerged from taylor's shadow only to be eclipsed this season by colorado's spectacular
darian hagan who led the buffaloes to the big eight championship an unbeaten regular season
an orange bowl date against notre dame and the top of the polls but when
it came time for the big eight coaches to select an all-conference quarterback the name
they chose was gerry gdowski the media chose hagan obviously the coaches found these numbers
hard to ignore while hagan passed for yards and ran for to become only the
fifth player in major college history to both pass and run for more than yards
in the same season gdowski passed for and ran for in fewer attempts than hagan
averaging yards a carry to hagan's when you figure that he's going to run some
quarterback sneaks and he's going to get sacked a few times it's really remarkable for
a quarterback to average almost eight yards a carry osborne said i'd say that's probably
the most significant of his statistics it is not however the only one that stands
out some others gdowski averaged total yards a game which was superior to hagan's average
of and established a cornhusker record while hagan accounted for touchdowns including by rushing gdowski
accounted for total and through the air one every seven pass attempts and only one
short of vince ferragamo's school record gdowski threw only two interceptions in pass attempts none
in his last and accumulated a passing efficiency rating of which would have surpassed jim
mcmahon's ncaa record of if gdowski had attempted the required passes a game instead of
only amazing kansas coach glen mason said of the numbers still outside his football crazed
home state and the projection rooms of cornhusker opponents gdowski is widely unrecognized much of
the reason for that it seems is that despite a 10-1 record and no national
ranking the cornhuskers were under publicized this season especially for a team that earned its
21st straight bowl bid none of nebraska's powder puff nonconference schedule which included games against
northern illinois utah minnesota and oregon state was televised by the networks or espn neither
were the cornhuskers big eight games against oklahoma and oklahoma state because those teams sanctioned
by the ncaa couldn't appear on television this season and nebraska hardly made the most
of its only national tv appearance losing to colorado in a showdown for the big
eight title but even that doesn't explain gdowski's lack of recognition while hagan passed for
only yards and ran for and a touchdown accounting for total yards in colorado's 27-21
victory over the cornhuskers gdowski ran for yards in fewer carries and passed for yards
and three touchdowns accounting for total yards against a defense that allowed only yards a
game it's understandable then that when asked what he hoped to get out of today's
game gdowski said i guess maybe a little respect though he averaged yards a carry
in rushing attempts as a sophomore and junior gdowski gave little indication of his passing
prowess throwing for only yards in two seasons after connecting on only of his attempts
three years ago as a starter on the freshman team i had probably a better
year than i could have imagined said gdowski who would have a year of eligibility
remaining if he had redshirted as a sophomore instead of spending the season third on
the depth chart obviously even gdowski didn't anticipate his emergence i was going to be
the third team quarterback and i was going to have a chance to play a
little bit and travel with the team he said of his decision not to redshirt
plus i knew i could graduate in four years i thought it would be better
just to get on with things if i could have looked into the future and
known i was going to have a year like this i would have liked to
redshirt but i'm happy with the way things turned out i don't regret anything

to yards and points and will counter the buckeyes size ohio state's offensive line averages
pounds with quickness people have been telling us how hard it's going to be moving
the ball against auburn and you can see that on the films said ohio state
quarterback greg frey whose improved play was instrumental in the buckeyes turnaround from a 4-6-1
finish in you can't really tell until you get out there though frey said i
don't go into a game worrying about whether we're going to run the ball or
throw it all i want to do is win we'll just do what we have
to do the buckeyes would prefer to run allowing carlos snow and scottie graham to
pound away at the defense and control the clock snow rushed for yards despite a
nagging knee problem and graham gained yards but frey has been effective enough throwing that
opponents can't take the passing game for granted the junior quarterback led the big ten
in passing efficiency and finished with completions in attempts for yards and touchdowns there have
been times this season when ohio state's best defense has been its offense the buckeyes
gave up yards and points but overcame it by averaging yards and points on offense
ohio state's 28-18 loss to michigan in the last game stopped a six-game winning streak

running rule change may have officials using eraser on record book
$BODY
january monday home edition words an obscure but potentially significant ruling has recently been enacted
that may change the face and certainly the record books of american road racing at
the recent convention of the athletics congress which governs track and field and road racing
a rule was passed which makes times run in point-to-point races ineligible for record consideration
the rule also modified the allowance made for downhill portions of races of course times
run on point-to-point courses would be considered records but only for that type of course
and would have little meaning times set on courses falling outside the new guidelines will
now be labeled noteworthy performances further the rules will be applied retroactively to all existing
distance racing records remember that last part but first a bit of background there are
basically three kinds of course configurations for distance races point-to-point runners start at point a
and finish at point b loop runners start at point a and go in a
loop to finish back at point a out-and-back runners start at point a go to
a halfway point and return on the same course to finish back at point a
there has long been discussion in the running community on which course is best and
most fair each has its merit but the out-and-back course is considered most fair a
point-to-point course may be designed so that runners may never face a prevailing head wind
for example a loop course may be designed to skirt a horrible hill on an
out-and-back course the runner experiences the best and worst of every factor the tail wind
on the first leg will be in his face coming back the downhill on which
he could coast on the way out turns into a grinding uphill on the way
back course variations have also made it difficult to compare relative times all of this
has led to years of debate in the road racing community both domestically and abroad
culminating in the passage of the tac rule so what so consider that america's biggest
marathons boston new york and chicago are all point-to-point races also consider that alberto salazar's
american marathon record for men was set at boston joan benoit samuelson's record for women
was set at chicago which may sneak in because of an rule change that liberalized
the allowable distance from the start to the finish line also consider that mark nenow's
10k american record at crescent city fails the start finish test and while the rule
does not apply to world records the international impact is the same especially since americans
do compete internationally the women's world record was set at london a point-to-point course the
seoul olympic marathon was point-to-point the course for the barcelona olympic marathon is point-to-point and
with elevation variations that may not make it eligible for record consideration the impact this
rule will have on american marathons is tremendous according to records compiled by the road
race management newsletter under this new rule the top all-time performances for u s men
are ineligible for record consideration that appears to make the american record holder at the
marathon tony sandoval with a set sept the idea of changing start finish lines after
decades of tradition may have race directors in a snit the boston marathon is actually
the hopkinton mass to boston marathon the new york city marathon's entire cachet is the
fact that the race starts on staten island and weaves through all five boroughs tradition
and logistics are not the only issues television loves the new england-in-spring look of the
early stages of the boston race and the ethnic neighborhoods of the new york course
apart from the start finish problem boston also fails the elevation requirement despite its well
known landmark heartbreak hill boston is basically a downhill race the new rule allows for
an elevation decrease of feet per mile boston has a net decrease of feet per
mile in fact according to basil honikman of tac boston's dramatic drop in elevation has
the effect of making it yards short this may account for the fact that up
to the end of six of the fastest times ever run by an american were
at boston the los angeles marathon is well within the tolerance levels of the new
rule l a is and always has been a loop course it is and shall
remain a flat course the elevation change for the race is one foot per mile
barely noticeable the total change is feet as compared to boston's drop of some feet
this rule change may serve to boost l a s attraction to elite american runners
who may not want to waste a world class effort on a course in which
they can't get a record certainly the rule will have a profound effect on the
sport however not all change is bad times on the roads have long been properly
called world bests not world records and for a reason unlike races on tracks road
race course have had little uniformity or even a modest adherence to worldwide standards only
by factoring in such elements as elevation wind and even the layout of a course
can uniform standards begin to be applied to the sport this difficult decision by tac
is merely the wave of the future and can only help lead to the eventual
ratification of road race records as accepted world records while internationally some racing officials are
dragging their feet on adopting tac's rule in their own federations look for this idea
to slowly gain worldwide acceptance former marathoner dick beardsley whose is second all-time among u

growth traffic airport are issues for 90s future high housing costs may send workers south of the border in search of affordable housing in the new decade
$BODY
january monday san diego county edition words people are lined up on the freeway trying
to get to work from san diego's most popular new suburb mexico it's a m
in minutes you and thousands of others will have beaten the morning rush you hope
only to sit at your desk for eight hours before returning to the san diego
tijuana drive time fray the scenario is more likely than you might imagine thousands may
work in america's finest city but they won't be able to live here those who
cannot afford california may look in desperation to baja california or points many miles east
of here welcome to san diego in the 1990s the place where the population will
continue to boom where the hispanic and asian communities will gain increasing prominence where the
work force will undergo sweeping changes it's the place with more traffic more smog and
a vexing need to resolve such problems as what to do with the airport and
how to build more jails with a population expected to reach nearly million in the
year growing from today's million san diego county will continue its urbanization curve through the
1990s demographers predict even more stunning growth is expected in the san diego unified school
district from to the turn of the century the number of students is expected to
increase to the largest increase is expected to be in the high school population but
planners say those increasing numbers of people will be increasingly squeezed for places to live
leading to higher prices vanishing open space and the emergence of new suburbs max schetter
director for the economic research bureau of the greater san diego chamber of commerce said
the county growth will produce surprising shifts and turns not the least of which is
the tijuana factor in which not only do mexicans continue to migrate to the united
states to find jobs but u s residents move in the other direction with affordable
housing in mind the poor and lower middle class might settle in mexico only because
the average price of a san diego home may be prohibitive by the year outstripping
gains in income the average household income is expected to rise during the decade to
but the average home price is expected to rise by to the huge numbers of
hispanics and asians coming into the county will work in san diego but may live
in mexico schetter said as housing becomes less affordable they'll have to consider tijuana or
points considerably east of here people will want to work here but can't afford to
live here it could affect all ethnic groups of the lower middle class including non-hispanic
whites as workers line up at the border creating massive traffic jams in an effort
to get to work schetter predicts the county will need new border crossings schetter and
other experts say that except for the upper class those who wish to move within
the county to trade up will be severely limited in doing so residents will have
massive equity in their homes but it won't do them much good unless they move
to another region because all the other houses in san diego county will have gone
up just as much in response to the demand for housing during the years from
to the number of housing units is expected to increase by to more than million
vacant land is expected to undergo a corresponding shrinkage of acres a loss of about
ethnic makeup given the press that the increasing hispanic population has received it is not
surprising to most san diegans that continuing migration and high birth rates will mean that
the number of hispanics in the county will more than double to from to the
turn of the century but what confounds even some demographers is that the asian population
will more than triple during that time to the change was not foreseen until recently
but richard madsen a sociologist at uc san diego and contributor to the book habits
of the heart individualism and commitment in american life said the asian explosion makes perfect
sense when considering its sources hong kong indochina and other cities in california control of
hong kong reverts from the british to the chinese in so madsen believes refugees will
leave hong kong san diego being only one destination over a gradual 7-year period he
believes the evacuation of indochinese from cambodia and vietnam has by no means ceased he
sees greater numbers of japanese and koreans arriving in san diego because of its promise
of opportunity you have as many as people a year leaving hong kong now he
said plus the hong kong government recently turned away thousands of indochinese refugees they had
to return to vietnam sooner or later some of those will come here madsen sees
the west coast as becoming much more multiethnic in the 90s every generation has had
its share of immigrants but clearly the most visible immigrants in this generation will be
asians and hispanics it presents certain challenges america has long been dominated by european values
the mentality has been waspish or european and that may change americans have tended to
be more open than some societies but on the other hand this nasty streak of
racism seems to be coming back i thought racism had waned after the civil rights
movement but that isn't the case at all the non-hispanic white population in of the
county's residents is expected to fall to by the year the county's black population is
expected to stay about the same at nearly neither the san diego police department nor
the san diego county sheriff's department keep statistics on so-called hate crimes except to say
that they rose significantly in the 1980s madsen fears the county's clash of cultures may
ignite more in the future he noted for instance that the number of asians entering
the state's elite university of california system increased dramatically during the 1980s with the trend
expected to flex itself more strongly during the next decade as minorities win out in
academic and professional challenges it's not hard to see he said why tensions will be
inflamed age the aging baby boomers will play a major role in making san diego
an older county in the year in the median age was years by the year
it is projected to be just about middle age jeff tayman senior planner with the
san diego assn of governments sandag said that change will affect the make-up of families
putting older parents at home with their children the baby boomers are having kids a
lot later he said we'll have a lot more parents and years old with kids
home it's kind of terrifying when you think about it we expect to see a
tremendous increase in high school students in the nineties madsen the sociologist said older parents
may be a change for the better such parents will probably be more mature more
comfortable materially and thus better able to take care of children he said i see
it as a plus they may feel more sympathetic to paying for education as much
as they do say for health care but those older parents are expected to face
double burdens caring for their own parents at the same time that they care for
their children as life expectancy increases the number of double generation elderly is expected to
increase younger senior citizens in their 60s for example caring for parents who are in
their 80s we'll see a significant increase in the elderly tayman said employment tayman predicts
dramatic changes in the county's work force he said that more than half the new
workers will be female and more than of new workers will be minorities he said
that only of new workers will be white non-hispanic males because of the increasing entry
of women into the workplace he foresees child care becoming perhaps the most major employment
issue of the 1990s in addition the new ethnic makeup will make affirmative action a
major issue of the new decade he said we expect to see a lot of
discrimination suits those workers are expected to go to jobs increasingly centered in the high
tech arena and focused more and more away from the military recent studies of employment
trends predict the number of direct military jobs staying the same in the county through
the year but schetter said those figures might have been outdated by a combination of
glasnost and the federal deficit it's a trend that's been growing for a long time
he said at the end of world war ii of all county jobs were oriented
to the military now the figure is somewhere near even if the number of military
workers remains the same it will be dwarfed by expected increases in other fields for
example the number of retail service employees will increase from to the turn of the
century from to manufacturing which employed people in is expected to provide jobs for by
the end of the new decade overall the county's work force is expected to increase
during that time by and almost jobs none of those in the armed services and
very little of that increase to be exact is expected to fall in the agricultural
category a sign of increasing urbanization in the county schetter said the county is becoming
more high tech more white collar more business oriented and much less dependent on the
military no sleepy little navy town any more no rural backwater in the shadow of
los angeles transportation the dramatic increase in the number of workers also puts pressure on
the county to find a way of getting those people to work because of the
growth of the work force the increase in traffic will be much greater than the
growth of the population tayman said tayman said san diego's drive alone compulsion has to
cease or the rush hour commute will be horrendous on the order say of houston
or los angeles he said the current average of san diegans commuting to work each
day by car must increase to or by the end of the decade to avoid
disastrous traffic snarls as a result tayman said car-pooling may evolve from the realm of
polite suggestion to a legislative mandate born of necessity bill tuomi sandag's transportation expert said
san diego county has more traffic today than it did nine years ago he said
new freeways extensions of old ones an expanded trolley line and a commuter rail system
through north county will ease the traffic burden but the key is boosting the passenger
load per car tuomi said that million people ride the county's trolley or bus lines
each year the number needs to reach million by in the 1990s the trolley's eastern
end now in el cajon will stretch as far as santee it will move north
from downtown to old town and will soon service the new convention center as well
tuomi said the no traffic hot spot of the 1990s is interstate specifically the junction
of interstates and interstate carries more than cars a day now tuomi said in the
number was so it's doubled in a decade we're expecting cars a day on i-5
by the year that's definitely a source of concern interstate is our most heavily traveled
freeway handling about cars a day we expect to hold at that number until the
year the traffic growth of east county is no longer as fast or fierce as
up north we expect the extension of california which now goes from i-5 to tierrasanta
to be extended to santee and to ease the west east burden dramatically the other
major transportation conflict of the 1990s will be the airport jack koerper sandag's special projects
director said the question of what to do with lindbergh field will be resolved in
the nineties one way or the other if it isn't if procrastination rules then that
in itself will be a decision koerper said some people don't act until there's a
crisis so maybe we'll have one the navy objects to making miramar naval air station
the site of a new regional air facility although the air station comes up repeatedly
among the panels charged with making a decision on a new location the navy says
the air station is not now and never will be available to civilian use koerper
sees potential crises as an air crash in the downtown area traffic so ugly on
harbor drive that you'll have to arrive two hours early to catch your flight or
we might have our air-carrier service curtailed because of use restrictions on the runway he
said lindbergh might be taxed with one big convention after another coming in to use
the convention center we'll find we don't have the airport to accommodate the convention center
and then we'll do something the prognosis tayman and others say san diego will be
more big-city in the years to come taking on the good and the bad that
come with high level urban living we may see a downtown sports arena and a
professional basketball or hockey team to play in it we should see at least one
more super bowl probably in at least one baseball all-star game for sure in and
maybe another world series tayman and others think planning is sophisticated enough here to prevent
san diego from becoming a crude clone of its northern neighbor los angeles ironically said
schetter of the chamber of commerce our organization was formed in and the issues they
were talking about then housing transportation water commerce jobs crimes are the same ones we're
talking about now we seem to have done pretty well between then and now i
see no reason why we can't move forward with hope on a growth curve profile
of san diego county an older and higher income population of san diegans will crowd
into more expensive houses in the year planners predict the county expect to add about
new residents in the 1990s while much public attention has been given to the projected

valley center's homeless put blame on building ban
$BODY
january monday san diego county edition words madge may put most of her savings into
a nice piece of property in valley center and planned to build a little house
for herself and her 6-year-old daughter in the pretty little town two years later she
still waits for a chance to build her dream home unable to obtain a building
permit because of a 9-year-old building moratorium in the valley and unable to sell the
land to anyone else she and her daughter have been living in a white frame
garage on the property roughing it without proper toilets or electricity and hoping that inspectors
look the other way her washer and dryer sit unused and unplugged in a corner
while she goes to the coin laundry each week i knew there was a building
moratorium but i thought the sewer was going in may said about buying the 3-acre
parcel my friend bob winsett sold it to me for a modest price he had
bought it in and the taxes were eating him up may had good reason to
believe that valley center was going to get a sewer system when she bought her
land the valley center municipal water district had been working on sewer plans for the
central part of the valley since the county board of supervisors in imposed a building
moratorium because the valley's septic systems posed a health hazard the moratorium brought a federal
grant for the 13-million sewer project and construction of the sewer project would have meant
the end of the moratorium but over the years the population around the valley had
changed from farmers dairymen and ranchers to retirees young families and others seeking to escape
from the urban hubbub newcomers to the valley northeast of escondido moved there for much
the same reasons that madge may did to get away from noise and traffic and
smog the thought of a country town with tract housing and traffic signals and shopping
malls that a sewer system would allow welded the valley's residents into an slow growth
anti sewer coalition soon after may bought her property the slow growth coalition campaigned for
and won the right to have a deciding vote on any project by the local
water district costing more than million the sewer project was dead and the federal grant
withdrawn only the decade-old moratorium remained although she has plenty of space for a septic
system may cannot put one in because of the moratorium which was placed on acres
of the central valley area after the rainy years of and during the late 1970s
and early 80s ground water levels in the valley rose nearly to the surface and
septic systems contaminated the runoff eleven septic systems failed for more than a year madge
may has attempted to talk sense to county officials and win an exemption from the
building moratorium after all the rainy years are long past and the ground water has
receded so low that it would take a 40-day deluge to bring them back up
to contamination levels she argues the moratorium was a political move to give the local
water district the emergency situation it needed to win a federal grant for a sewer
system she said now in the driest year in the past century why can't the
county board of supervisors allow one financially strapped woman to build one small septic system
runoff from may's septic system would raise the valley center ground water level by only
of an inch in years engineers tell her and the irony of it is that
i could plant my acres in citrus and put 3-million gallons of irrigation water into
the ground every year and do it legally may said it just doesn't make sense
but no matter what you say no matter how rational you are they just won't
listen may is not alone a lot of property owners are in the same fix
unable to do a thing with their property ben benson owned industrially zoned property in
the moratorium area and complains that the only thing i could do was pay taxes
on it and graze horses on it fred lloyd a valley center businessman said merchants
in town are being held hostage by the moratorium how can the town grow and
businesses thrive when a person can't even add a bedroom he asks jack sharp has
owned property in the moratorium area for more than a dozen years and planned to
build his retirement home there he isn't getting any younger he says val wynn a
civil engineer with offices in valley center pointed out that the moratorium has forced development
out of the logical town center onto the edge of town the school district had
to build its new schools out on the fringe of valley center what is happening
businessmen and town folk agree is that valley center is growing around the edges leaving
the moratorium area bare like a hole in the middle of a doughnut janet waltz
assistant chief of county environmental health services sympathizes with people caught in moratorium especially with
madge may i admire her greatly waltz said of may she has tremendous perseverance but
waltz takes issue with those who say the building ban is no longer needed in
these dry years despite the lack of rainfall for the past three winters waltz said
there are still septic tank failures in valley center and the ground water level has
not retreated all that much county supervisors echoed her opinion earlier this month when they
refused to lift the valley center building moratorium perhaps because of the plight of may
and the dozens of other property owners caught in the building ban slow growth forces
and building advocates are slowly edging toward a compromise sewers in a rural community marty
tisdale chairman of the valley center planning group reports that the key players in extremely
diverse factions are coming together to revise the community plan lowering the high density zoning
that was imposed in anticipation of a sewer system ken knust who represents the pro-sewer
forces says both sides do not agree wholeheartedly on anything but acknowledges that they are
talking for the very first time madge may is in the center of the peace
negotiations coming home from work for a quick meal with her daughter in their rustic
shed then rushing off to a subcommittee meeting which often lasts well into the night
she resents the time it is taking and admits that daughter amy views the latest
shift in the growth vs no-growth battle as just another thing that takes me away
from home for three or four hours at a time may doesn't know if the
compromise talks will earn her the right to build her house and she's getting mighty

oceanside drugs violence blamed on gang invasion
$BODY
january monday san diego county edition words oceanside police say drug use and violence among
the city's long established ethnic gangs have been overshadowed by the arrival of crips gang
members from los angeles and elsewhere looking to set up a permanent cocaine trade we're
working three or four shootings by these new gangsters in town said ruben sandoval a
seven year veteran of the police department's gang unit which was increased from two to
four officers to handle the crips according to oceanside police reports four incidents within a
10-day period in october reflected the violence that they believe has been brought by the
newcomers on oct a woman was shot in the leg when she tried to stop
gang members from using her apartment to sell drugs she told investigating officers that l
a crips gang members had been using her apartment to sell cocaine on oct two
women allege they were fired at by crips after one of the women told a
gang member her little brother would no longer sell drugs for them a victim said
in the police report that l a crips had recently moved into the oceanside area
and had taken up selling rock cocaine from an apartment on oct a woman told
police that four los angeles crips forced their way into her apartment after beating up
a man outside in a drug dispute she said gang members had been trying to
use her apartment as a base for drug sales on oct two local men were
shot and wounded by two suspects a police report said one victim recounted that his
assailant had claimed to be a member of a los angeles gang the shooting occurred
when one of the men warned the gang members to stop selling cocaine from his
sister's apartment such bloodshed has become commonplace in metropolitan areas like los angeles and san
diego but drug related violence by outsiders is new to the people of oceanside where
gang fighting was largely confined to hispanic and samoan gangs arguing over their turf police
say that about to los angeles based crips first came to oceanside in the summer
of selling cocaine from hotels and motels on the weekends and returning to los angeles
during the week they dealt drugs for six months until some were arrested beefed up
police patrols pressed most of the others to leave evidenced by a sharp decline in
cocaine sales say police we were saturating the streets with to officers said oceanside police
chief lee drummond a few months of peace followed but last summer a new batch
of crips arrived there were more of them said sandoval about or he estimated most
came from los angeles but police learned from driver's licenses and vehicle registration that others
came from san bernardino lancaster and perris the difference is they're going into certain residential
areas and buying off the homeowners by giving them drugs or paying them sandoval said
the crips live here but resupply themselves with drugs from los angeles he said an
alarmed drummond initiated a study of the city's gang problem by law enforcement consultants including
manuel ortega police chief in bell cudahy and lt paul jefferson of the los angeles
police department the study released last month concluded that gang related crime in oceanside while
still largely confined to traditional turf wars has recently taken on a distinctly more dangerous
and criminal nature because of the arrival of predatory gangs oceanside police believe their city
has attracted the crips because it is located between los angeles and san diego and
it represents a new market for rock and crack cocaine if gone unchecked they could
set up a lucrative market here drummond said a 20-year-old oceanside woman who used to
sell crack bought from los angeles crips living in oceanside said there's opportunity here the
ones who come down here are small frys up there but down here they're really
big said leilani who spoke on the condition that her street name and last name
not be used she said a quantity of cocaine that sells for in los angeles
gets in oceanside she said crips enlist rushers who stand outside a crack house to
make quick transactions with buyers who drive or walk buy and also hire drug users
to deal cocaine for them downtown if their dope is good each of five rushers
can make or more a day leilani said crips like to have and 14-year-olds selling
for them because when they get into trouble they're just going to juvenile hall but
they're not going to do no big time sandoval said police have arrested more than
users and dealers over the last three months and search warrants have been issued to
enter suspected drug houses scores of arrests have been made around the block of north
hill street where rick trevino sandoval's partner for three years said people working for the
crips were doing a brisk and highly visible business they were blatantly dealing said trevino
but downtown cocaine street sales appear to have fallen over the last few weeks and
sandoval believes the lull may be caused by the cold nights or the increased police
enforcement

asian americans put quality above price survey says marketing the new data on preferences will likely add to advertisers perplexity over how to reach this potentially lucrative but culturally and linguistically diverse population
$BODY
january monday home edition words although asian consumers have a reputation for frugality in their
homelands where saving is encouraged their asian american counterparts are avid shoppers generally less concerned
about price and convenience than they are about quality according to new research the findings
are bound to renew the debate among advertisers and marketers about how to best reach
america's rich mix of chinese japanese koreans filipinos and southeast asian immigrants as well as
highly assimilated asian americans although such consumers are widely viewed by madison avenue as a
potentially lucrative market because of their comparatively high incomes and education levels differences in language
and culture make them difficult to reach experts say most advertisers think that all they
need to do is simply translate an english ad to reach this market said david
chen executive vice president of the los angeles advertising firm muse cordero chen amp baca
but there are problems with that there are many differences among asian people i can
understand advertisers being concerned with the difficulty chen said but it's not a difficulty we
cannot overcome themes like stressing quality have universal appeal among many asian groups a study
by the sri gallup organization of lincoln neb found that in choosing a product of
chinese american consumers surveyed ranked the quality of the product more important than price store
location or service similarly an sri gallup survey last year of japanese and korean households
in southern california found that while there were significant cultural differences between the two groups
both are upscale shoppers with rapidly expanding purchasing power more recently both impact resources of
columbus ohio and the find svp research organization in new york found asian americans to
be avid shoppers who are generally more concerned about product quality than the general population
for instance while price was more important to the total population than among the asian
americans surveyed in the impact study of the asian americans said quality is the most
important reason for selecting a men's clothing outlet compared to of the total population quality
of course is a subjective concept and it is still unclear to many experts why
asian americans embrace certain brands or whether they will remain loyal to them as they
become more acculturated nevertheless some marketing specialists believe that companies should continue to direct special
campaigns at even highly assimilated third and fourth generation asians although convincing advertisers of that
approach has been difficult we've been banging on the door since and now we're beginning
to see greater acceptance of the asian market said greg sullivan president of asian television
sales a san francisco company that sells advertising time on three asian language television stations
including ksci in los angeles what advertisers don't realize is that if you are an
asian immigrant of this stuff on tv you've never heard of concentrated in three areas
california hawaii and the new york metropolitan area asian americans represent a large and rapidly
growing market the asian population has increased since in los angeles county alone according to
a census bureau estimate and because the mean family income of asian americans is about
higher than that of latinos their buying power is substantially greater said holmes stoner head
of artesa media services a los angeles ad agency that specializes in marketing to latinos
and asians yet unlike latino immigrants who come from countries closer to the united states
asians are not as familiar with the broad universe of american goods as a result
many asian americans flock to a dominant brand deemed the best by their immigrant neighbors
experts say for example studies conducted between and by sri gallup found that of chinese
consumers surveyed used tide laundry detergent of koreans used ajax cleaner and of japanese used
either crest or colgate toothpaste no other brand had more than a share in each
of those product categories as a result many experts see a tremendous opportunity to instill
brand loyalty and grab a large share of the asian american market by trumpeting the
quality or the prestige of their product to newly arrived asian immigrants in advertising to
the general public for example metropolitan life insurance co of new york runs ads featuring
the comic strip character snoopy saying get met it pays but in a special campaign
directed at chinese and korean americans the company stresses its prestige as well as asian
values such as financial security and family responsibility instead of showing snoopy the ads shows
several massive office buildings owned by metropolitan life it's a more tangible identification of where
our financial strength lies said william orton a marketing executive with metropolitan life we did
a fair amount of market research in terms of what major themes would appeal to
the asian community we emphasize the prestige of dealing with a company that was here
yesterday and will be here tomorrow similarly las vegas hotels such as the desert inn
and caesars palace have held chinese new year parties advertised on asian language tv and
put on other glossy promotions stressing the quality and prestige of their hotel's accommodations to
entice both asian american and foreign tourists caesars also has marketing offices throughout asia as
well as in heavily chinese american monterey park the asian community is a significant market

as the 157-page study published in december by find svp prefer at amp t's general
market approach saying it's a waste of money to specifically target the asian american market
they say asian cultures are too different to reach efficiently with one kind of campaign
even though asian people who come here have their own ethnic television the majority are
watching regular network tv said clifford yuguchi president of the los angeles advertising firm bozell
yuguchi inc what companies ought to do is pull off some of those white people
and show more asians deborah ching executive director of the chinatown service center in los
angeles says she too would like to see more asian americans on tv but she
said she is turned off by some efforts that have racist and sexist depictions of
asian men as less than masculine and asian women as exotic desirable and subservient she
cited as particularly offensive the singapore airlines singapore girl commercial that shows attractive female flight
attendants serving passengers bob candiotti a spokesman for singapore airlines responded it's true that the
presentation of singapore girl has been one of our ongoing ad campaigns for several years
to us the singapore girl is symbolic of our high level of service their uniforms
are actually quite modest they wear ankle length dresses we do not view the ads
as being sexist or racist although many marketers say they are moving away from unfavorable
asian caricatures there are still slip-ups and outright mistakes playboy magazine once wished chinese celebrants
year new happy in a full page newspaper ad and filipinos the nation's largest asian
american group are sometimes mistakenly lumped with latinos by marketers because filipinos often have spanish
surnames a more practical problem in reaching the asian market is the lack of national
media unlike spanish language television which has two national broadcasting networks there is no national
asian tv instead regional systems such as ksci channel in los angeles and ktsf channel
in san francisco provide programming in areas with large asian populations the print medium is
even more fragmented in southern california there are at least vietnamese language newspapers more than
a dozen chinese newspapers and three japanese papers unless you are willing to get in
there and get your hands dirty the asian american market can be really intimidating said
stoner of artesa advertising you can't go out there with a typical kind of ad
and try to be all things to all people indeed although find svp agreed with
other experts that asian americans have a commitment to obtaining products and services noted for
having the best quality the study went on to conclude that in reality each of
the separate asian american ethnic groups is a separate ethnic market the only characteristic they
all have in common is their american ness and it is only through their american
ness that the various groups can be reached through the same marketing campaign

rocky mountain west receiving tourism boost from far east travel industry america's mountain states have benefited from a major push to attract asian tourists to the region's scenic views forests and national parks
$BODY
january monday home edition words in every way but one the slick new magazine that
just hit the stands looks like every other travel mag you've picked up on airplanes
and in doctors offices the articles consist of hyperbolic prose about mountain splendor and natural
wonders the lavish color pictures show off colorado's most scenic mountains forests rivers and national
parks and the advertisements promote hotels restaurants dude ranches and ski resorts but this new
journal colorado gaido is written entirely in japanese and the only newsstands where you can
buy it are in tokyo nagoya fukuoka and other japanese cities colorado gaido colorado guide
and its sister publication oregon treiru oregon trail both published by a portland firm called
pacific gateways are key elements of a major new thrust across the rocky mountain west
to attract tourists and their money from the nations of the pacific rim american travel
markets have started focusing on the pacific rim as the high growth area the first
priority said max ollendorf director of market development for the u s travel and tourism
administration the strongest push he added comes from the western states manifestations of the new
drive are evident throughout the region on the ski slopes at big resorts like deer
valley and snowbird you now see trail signs in japanese as well as english at
the airport in las vegas tour companies quote prices for their grand canyon sightseeing flights
in yen as well as dollars in the casinos at las vegas you can now
play asian games of chance like pai gow and sic bo at the edge of
a forest not far from downtown portland sits a perfect japanese tea house complete with
tatami floors and sliding shoji doors the effort to attract asians is part of a
larger pattern of change that is transforming the economic structure of the mountain west with
energy mineral and timber markets in the doldrums the western states have been moving away
from traditional extraction industries toward the attraction industry tourism people have discovered that you can
make more from a forest by leaving it in place and charging visitors to ski
through it than you can by cutting it down and selling the timber observed sen
timothy e wirth d-colo because tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in every
western state it was natural to look for new markets and for the states on
the pacific side of america a natural place to look was the booming economies on
the other side of the pacific a year ago the travel councils of eight western
states pooled their money to fund a new promotional outfit called visit usa west which
exists for one purpose to sell asians on the natural wonders of the rocky mountain
and pacific coast states the sales effort seems to be scoring points the number of
japanese tourists visiting wyoming jumped this year to double the figure for according to the
state's travel development office japanese skiing at resorts in utah increased from essentially zero two
years ago to last season the state travel council reports the trend has been a
boon in a part of the country that missed most of the 1980s expansion and
since the money that foreign tourists spend here is counted as export revenue in national
trade accounts every skier from tokyo schussing down ajax mountain at aspen helps offset the
u s trade deficit with japan tourism is second only to aircraft and space equipment
in total export revenue said jill collins of the federal travel and tourism administration foreign
tourists spent an estimated billion in the united states in a huge increase over the
year before that means that foreign tourism is america's fastest growing export commodity and the
pacific rim is the fastest growing market for this export although state tourism officials here
all talk hopefully about drawing visitors from taiwan south korea and australia the pacific rim
market today is for all intents and purposes the japanese market for some states this
is nothing new hawaiian hotels have done a thriving trade in japanese tour groups and
honeymooners for two decades now california has always been a big draw and alaska also
has had a fairly large japanese tourist trade but there was no such tradition for
oregon a state whose name the japanese have difficulty both pronouncing and spelling a geography
book used in japanese schools shows a state called olegon and so oregon's division of
tourism set out to create an instant tradition the state paid for the filming of
a sentimental dramatic movie oregon nikki oregon diary which tells the story of a young
japanese boy living in oregon who falls in love with the state and its natural
beauty the two-hour film is shown annually on the national fuji television network the result
recognition of the name oregon among japanese adults went from in to this year and
the state broke all records by drawing about asian tourists mostly japanese in for most
western states however appealing to japanese tourists means breaking long established routines the standard route
for japanese travelers coming to los angeles has followed a path known in the japanese
travel trade as the golden triangle it consists of various stops around los angeles disneyland
universal studios followed by a trip to las vegas with a side trek to the
grand canyon followed by a stop in san francisco and then the long flight home
to break that habit the western states are busily advertising such off-the-triangle wonders as yellowstone
and glacier national parks colorado dude ranches and salt lake city's temple square much of
this effort is aimed at tourists who have been to the united states once many
japanese on their second visit don't want to go back to the same places again
explained kasho furuya director of pacific rim sales for las vegas based scenic airlines perhaps
the most successful campaign was the major promotion called in created by osamu sam hoshino
of utah's travel division and adopted by six major tour packagers in tokyo it took
japanese tourists along u s highway the two-lane route sometimes called the most beautiful highway
in america the route starts at glacier national park on the canadian border and winds
south through wyoming and utah passing near several other major parks before its terminus at
the north rim of the grand canyon skiing is one of the major tourist businesses
of the mountain region but this fact has been lost on the japanese until recently
japanese skiers traveling overseas have traditionally gone to europe or the canadian rockies that too
is beginning to change thanks to major sales efforts by the big rocky mountain resorts
at utah's deer valley for example japanese skiers are greeted by japanese hosts when they
arrive the resort provides japanese speaking ski instructors and japanese language restaurant guides the number
of japanese skiers choosing colorado seems almost certain to increase now that japanese investors have
purchased two of its biggest resorts breckenridge and steamboat springs to win the japanese market
american travel destinations have to be creative dorothy maitland who owns a travel agency in
kalispell mont has learned to be creative during the past five years while making tokyo-to-montana
packages a key part of her business when maitland first got the idea she said
she was stymied by the fact that the japanese like to see the sights from
a train i said this is montana the only train we've got is amtrak from
seattle to chicago and that goes through here in the middle of the night after
stewing over this dilemma for a while maitland hit on the solution she printed up
a japanese brochure promoting the midnight rail journey as a romantic adventure the moonlight express
and it worked we're selling tours on that moonlight train almost every day of the
summer she said and our japanese customers are buying like mad researcher karen brown contributed

canadians swell sales along u s border retail a stronger canadian dollar has helped boost u s sales but some border residents are annoyed by the swarm of foreign shoppers
$BODY
january monday home edition words canadian shoppers have made this holiday season jolly for u
s retailers but some residents are feeling a lack of good will toward fellow shoppers
from across the border low u s prices and a comparatively strong canadian dollar have
caused canadians to throng grocery stores liquor marts and factory outlets throughout this border city
the prices check it out said manny hilario who drove miles from brampton ontario to
shop at the factory outlet mall one recent saturday outside in an overflowing parking lot
ontario plates outnumbered new york plates more than three to one the crowded lots long
checkout lines and delays entering canada on the area's three international bridges have caused tempers
to rise at times a group of six niagara falls residents announced recently that they
were forming a group called people against canadian shoppers to press local merchants to deal
with the problems we have nothing against them canadians personally but we do think something
could be done to improve the situation for everyone steve hughes a spokesman for the
group told the niagara gazette hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming canadians for
everything from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting gasoline across the border in extra tanks
that effort in turn has prompted u s business and tourism officials to hasten to
assure canadians that they are still welcome it's easy to blow this out of proportion
and make out that there's a major war going on said ray wigle spokesman for
the niagara falls convention and visitors bureau the convention and visitors bureau and the niagara
falls area chamber of commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and expand
checkouts local governments have been asked to increase traffic control in order to reduce the
complaints local canada customs officials have asked the agency that operates the international bridges to
expand the customs facilities and are trying to persuade ottawa to allocate more staff same-day
shopping traffic across the rainbow and whirlpool bridges has increased by almost over the past
four years and at the lewiston queenston bridge the main route to major canadian cities
such as hamilton and toronto traffic is up over that period said john johnston district
manager for canada customs operations in niagara falls theories abound as to why the number
of shoppers has multiplied though the year-old u s canada free trade pact isn't considered
a direct cause the agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on several categories of merchandise but
has not yet affected the duties paid by individual shoppers at the border still free
trade may have subtly boosted cross border shopping by helping to strengthen the canadian dollar
the canadian dollar trades at about u s cents these days after falling as low
as cents earlier in the decade niagara falls n y also has a built-in price
advantage because western new york is one of the cheaper regions of the united states
but niagara falls ontario is an extension of the pricey toronto metropolitan area wigle said
price is not the only attraction of the united states some canadian shoppers said in
groceries anything new they come out with in the united states is in canada the
year after said lisa morrice of hamilton ontario u s grocery chains began advertising heavily
across the border in the past few months after seeing the stronger dollar and the
increased willingness of canadians to cross the bridges canadian merchants say they can't compete with
u s prices

he said indicating the 20-person queue to the left of the entrance if you're not
on the guest list you have to wait here he continued motioning to a slightly
longer line at the right now if you only think you're on the guest list
you might not be so unless you know you're on the list don't stand in
the guest list line sound inviting it is to many in hollywood who all-too willingly
stand in line especially on mondays when a star studded jam session draws celebrity guests
only a notch below the rumors so they can pay to be sardined around the
elongated horseshoe bar or on the dance floor where it's too crowded to dance and
too loud to talk and pay five bucks a pop for mixed drinks the pro-jam

nine songs michael bolton and rick james are among those known to turn up even
rocker wanna-be john mcenroe plugged in his guitar recently and the rumors maybe jeff beck
maybe phil collins maybe eric clapton said club publicist joe d'ambrosio as the cozy understatedly
chinese themed main room started to fill up on this occasion the rumors proved a
bust as was one about paul mccartney the week before the crowd had to settle
for sam kinison and gary busey destroying wild thing plus the now-standard guest appearance of

for all that the china club is fairly egalitarian as these clubs go there's none

both this club and its new york namesake which has served as a successful celebrity
filled hot spot for five years we don't play the we don't like your clothes

that david bowie and axl are over there she said some people find the conservative
atmosphere pleasant that's enough for them they don't want to deal with the underground and
the trendiness but if not for the impressive guest list you'd have to wonder if
the club could remain the hottest place in town it certainly wouldn't draw the paparazzi
who stake out the club religiously we give the club a lot of publicity said
celebrity photographer al ortega during his vigil stuff we shoot here gets published at in
the morning after the club had closed ortega and several colleagues were still working coaxing
a complaining justine bateman to dutifully pose as she headed across argyle to the parking
lot for now the china club's magic is working but even those who are impressed
expect it will wear off eventually this is great marveled one record industry executive who

critic at large hopes arise with the dawn of a new decade

january monday home edition words like birthdays years divisible by have a special aura about
them in the case of our private birthdays the aura gets darker and darker as
the numbers go up turning has a chill about it like a cloud passing the
face of the sun and let us not speak of at all the world's birthdays
have no such darkening auras and it is a small miracle of our lives that
no matter how dark things have been for the individual or the world up through
dec new year's eve always carries the hope that things will change for the better
the hope may be as thin as a penlight at the end of a very
long tunnel as it has often been in wartime but the hope is there because
things have always gotten better before or so you tell yourself as the bells ring
and the horns toot in the crisp night air even in the hard realistic light
of new year's morning a guarded optimism is at very least an allowable state of
mind and if the old year has ended up in a rush of good news
personal or collective as this one surely has collectively speaking then the new year begins
with a sense of possibility that is headier than any champagne the year lately dead
and the ending decade have been memorialized and analyzed to a true fare thee well
and seeing the bits of film and tape hearing the litany of new voices discovered
and familiar voices gone still and glimpsing again the triumphs and the tragedies it is
impressive to realize how much we've all borne witness to but as mort sahl once
remarked in an album title the future lies ahead and the view from new year's
morning is indubitably ahead not to those intimidating resolutions yes yes we're all going to
eat less and exercise more and save more and be better persons in each and
every way at least through wednesday resolutions unreal to begin with tend to have rather
short lives on the other hand there are hopes and the first day of any
year is nothing if not a time of hope that should last longer than the
resolutions i hope for example that the movie makers will rethink the prevailing conventional wisdom
that only home runs count singles and doubles have a place in the hollywood scheme
of things too those swollen budgets averaging million to million but occasionally peaking at twice
that or more have deprived the movies of one of their greatest strengths variety variety
in size themes tone casting the argument always is that little pictures cost as much
to distribute as big ones so you're better off making big ones that have more
selling points the trouble is that the big budgets carry timid compromises like barnacles there
are signs of hope already in the success of modest cost films such as sex
lies and videotape do the right thing and even in its limited showings kenneth branagh's
henry v the hope at last is for more hope i hope the television networks
read the handwriting on the screen about their still declining share of prime time viewing
they are losing to cable to independents to vcrs indeed their share of viewing time
may be even lower than the measurers can measure and what the networks might well
ask are their viewers viewing instead even less objectionable programming which is to say even
blander and more derivative stuff not exactly a lot more sports certainly on cable which
feeds an evidently insatiable appetite in the society beyond sports what we watch appears to
be a mosaic of what you can only call the good stuff films and specials
for cable the networks abandoned variety shows too quickly plays documentaries profiles news in breadth
and depth and not without a touch of irony the best of what network television
did in the past the excellence of which now also carries a heavy icing of
nostalgia the networks old quest for lop least objectionable programming is obviously an inadequate response
to the new challenge they face the hope is that they will try upgrading their
offerings to a viewership that is now anything but captive television's not a wasteland never
was entirely there were oases in the thinnest of times and the medium's inventiveness and
immediacy have at their best been spectacular the power of television's news coverage increasingly shapes
history as well as recording it but even here the networks are under siege from
cnn and other quarters the hope i think is for a counteroffensive by the networks
taking risks and showing their undoubted muscle instead of cutting costs and plotting spinoffs i
can't say i hope but i wish that the pop music i hear seemed to
originate deeper in the soul for a time in the 60s particularly the voices of
rock spoke for a generation and reflected early on its angers and concerns its rejection
of what it saw as outworn values but its essentially positive aspirations for change today
much of what i hear or read about seems to me to reflect the disenchantment
of senders and receivers it's hard not to sense a strained quest for commercial novelty
preferably built on shock value cynicism pervades the music or probably more accurately the industry
it seems no accident that the possibility of a beatles reunion holds such fascination for
so many or that the individual beatle tours have done so well there is a
terrific nostalgia for the relative innocence and the romantic idealism that their music carried in
the 60s when they owned the world it is also no accident that someone like
bruce springsteen who has a point of view and whose attraction is therefore lyrical as
well as musical should command such a following i remember watching a rehearsal of the
byrds and a young man beside me shouting this is it facade show business is
dead it isn't it just uses megawatt amplifiers and wears artfully torn jeans my hope
i guess is that out there somewhere are new composer musicians who are looking beyond
a facile and fashionable cynicism to find new angers and concerns it may well be
beyond them but we can not give up the possibility of change there is a
banquet of subsidiary hopes lurking about i hope the theater will rediscover the lean sophisticated
musical as an alternative to the overwhelmingly spectacular musical i hope for the spirit of
rodgers and hart as well as revivals of rodgers and hart i hope the los
angeles theatre center will hang in there while more and more customers find their way
to it and discover that it is a safe and exciting oasis in an undeniably
off-putting part of downtown the operating losses have not dimmed bill bushnell's daring as a
producer and i hope they never will i hope the writers of crime fiction will
ease off on drunken private eyes and serial killers both are becoming not so much
bores as trivializations to end on a more cosmic level i hope no i pray
that mikhail s gorbachev holds his own against the troglodytic old guardsman who undoubtedly lie
in wait for him he has diverted us all from a collision course with catastrophe
the world is not free of terror or terrorists but it is immeasurably saner than
it was a year ago and a hope for more of the same fits this
morning like none other

hidden population poses census windfall for cities
$BODY
january monday orange county edition words it was a natural fear and quach tho ninh
was no different than the rest in the grim months after the fall of saigon
in vietnamese authorities would conduct an occasional head count marching house to house with automatic
rifles slung over their shoulders this was only a census but the questions invariably strayed
were you in the army of the south what are your beliefs your politics quach
would always give the correct responses the answers that would keep him alive now more
than a decade has passed quach has come to orange county hoping for a new
life one recent day the 46-year-old immigrant was sitting in an english language class grappling
with strange new vowels and syllables when a visitor appeared a man from the u
s census bureau this quach soon realized was different than the homeland the census employee
a slight vietnamese man named vong ngo softened up the class with a few one-liners
in his native tongue then explained the importance of the nationwide survey the spiel did
the trick afterward quach without fear was eager to participate in the u s census
such small victories however could prove the exception rather than the rule when the census
is launched in late march while the past decade saw perhaps the greatest influx of
foreign newcomers in orange county's history many of those immigrants from south of the border
and indochina might go uncounted in the upcoming national survey they are among the nation's
hidden population which also includes the homeless families tucked into garages or vans and drifters
with no fixed addresses wary of the government and its emissaries both recent immigrants and
the homeless typically are not counted in the u s census although the census missed
about of the overall u s populace in the undercount was greater among minorities with
the rate of omission for black and latino inner city residents pegged at the undercount
is unfortunate since the census serves as an important springboard for help it bears directly
on the distribution of about billion in federal aid and millions more in state subsidies
for a variety of programs each city's share of that money is generally based on
its numbers of poor homeless or unemployed people federal officials contend that the census can
overcome the daunting obstacles to produce a reasonably complete count even among immigrants and in
the pockets of poverty that lace orange county and other communities the bureau has pressed
ahead with a spate of programs to reach the types of people who have been
overlooked in past decades in orange county census officials will enlist the help of churches
schools and social service agencies outreach specialists have been dispatched to give presentations to community
organizations adult english language classes and head start groups census officials also plan to hire
temporary employees directly from the ethnic minority neighborhoods marching into apartment complexes and housing projects
to make a pitch for recruits by tapping workers from the community officials hope to
ease the tensions and worries of residents facing the census orange county cities such as
santa ana have also helped promoting the census with videos on local cable channels and
distributing literature the census bureau meanwhile is gearing up for an ambitious one-night campaign to
count the homeless dubbed shelter and street night the special push is expected to far
surpass the bureau's past enumeration efforts which have focused on flophouses and other places of
refuge but several problems persist the census bureau's promotional literature in spanish and other languages
has largely failed to materialize in district offices throughout the united states aghast at the
information gap a nonprofit latino group has stepped in to provide pamphlets in spanish for
many regions of the country for the indochinese communities in orange county local census officials
have resorted to producing their own literature drawing up and photocopying rudimentary pamphlets for distribution
beyond logistical glitches critics also see problems with the census form the questionnaire comes only
in english with a small paragraph at the bottom giving a toll free number to
order a copy in spanish the form is unavailable in vietnamese chinese or any of
the scores of other languages spoken in the united states our feeling is a lot
of people will not even see the paragraph at the bottom of the census saying
they can request one in spanish said berta saavedra state census coordinator for the mexican
american legal defense and education fund it could cause problems and it's even worse for
people who speak other languages census officials attribute such drawbacks mostly to a lack of
funds but they insist the informational literature will be arriving at most district offices in
january they also stress that residents who speak another language can get help at special
translation centers it's a concern said fernando tafoya a census district manager in orange county
but it's up to all of us on the local level to get the word
out and i feel we've got all the bases covered the literature is important but
what's even more important is the personal contact we hope to establish such a face-to-face
approach could prove invaluable undocumented immigrants most of them latinos settled in cities such as
santa ana and anaheim fear the census will be used by immigration officials to track
them down illegal immigrants are counted by the census despite repeated efforts by some congressmen
to repeal the practice even those granted legal status under the amnesty program are sometimes
filled with distrust or don't understand the benefits of being counted authorities say new arrivals
from vietnam cambodia and laos carry not only fears imported from their homelands but a
suspicion that the census might help housing authorities root out large families packed into cramped
apartments in immigrant enclaves like orange county's little saigon in westminster most of our efforts
have to be aimed at saturating the community with accurate information about the census said
father jaime soto vicar of the hispanic community for the catholic diocese of orange we
need to get out the message that the information is confidential and that the census
could actually help them a lot the news is only beginning to trickle out consider
the case of natividad a 26-year-old latino woman in santa ana an illegal immigrant who
asked that only her first name be used natividad said she did not know what
the census is the mother of four also said she feared filling out government forms
because of what she believes is the threat of deportation but maria another undocumented immigrant
said she planned to participate in the census even though many of her friends are
too frightened to be counted my friends have a lot of concern that the census
is a way the government can find out we are here illegally said maria who
learned about the nationwide survey from a spanish language news program there are others just
like them in anaheim in westminster in santa ana and garden grove and that is
where people like vong ngo come in a bespectacled 29-year-old with a wife and two
children ngo came to the united states as a boat person in after five years
under the communist regime in vietnam now a community outreach specialist for the census bureau
he spends his days combing the indochinese communities throughout southern california urging people to come
forward and be counted so it was that he arrived one recent day for a
presentation at cambodian family inc a nonprofit community services agency in santa ana talking in
a mix of english and vietnamese ngo stressed that the census is confidential moreover he
pointed out how the count would actually help the community more money would come for
day-care centers for health care for sidewalks on a street we have to explain it
in terms of how it will help their own neighborhood and family ngo said that's
why these presentations are important but there's never enough there is no way that we
can spread out the message to everyone across town tafoya was delivering a similar talk
to a room packed with about young latino families at a community center a murmur
filled the room and small children in hooded jackets squirmed at their parents feet as
tafoya spoke in english but the audience grew attentive when he broke into spanish afterward
tafoya talked of building bridges you're sort of in their environment when you come out
to these meetings he said it strengthens the relationship and it helps that we're going
to give some of them a job with the census the others know that their
neighbor is not going to do something to hurt them but it is a fragile
trust some community leaders argue that unconnected events such as an immigration sweep a few
days or weeks before the census could convince many immigrants not to participate they have
asked the immigration and naturalization service for a moratorium on sweeps in the months before
the census if they decide to raid it'll put a damper on a complete count
said saavedra these people don't understand that one hand of the federal government doesn't always
know what the other is doing when they think of the government they think of
the ins irs fbi it all begins to run together the census bureau faces no
less troubling a dilemma with the homeless street corner preachers and bedraggled bag ladies drifting
on the periphery of society often hold a chilling animosity toward any type of government
representative to prepare for the count census officials have been putting their heads together with
homeless advocates and others to pinpoint all the shelters and street locations that need to
be visited on march the massive operation will begin across the country shelters and low-cost
motels will be visited between p m and midnight streets will be searched the next
morning from a m to a m sleeping persons will not be awakened but enumerators
will estimate as best they can the person's age and race even with such tactics
a percentage of the united states hidden population will likely remain uncounted experts say for
many cities that will mean less federal money for streets social services and other programs
in santa ana for instance officials estimate that million a year could be lost during
the coming decade if the city's estimated latino newcomers are omitted officials in los angeles
which has an even greater variety of needy immigrants say their city stands to lose
million annually if there is an under count it boils down to the fact that
if we do not count everybody these people will not exist on paper noted santa
ana councilman miguel a pulido everything from reapportionment to tax dollars will be affected eager
to ensure an accurate tally many state and city officials are pushing for the census
bureau to use a new technique it has developed to estimate the nation's hidden population
and adjust the census accordingly the concept is similar to a 100-year-old method for counting
fish in a lake immediately after the census an intense recount will be conducted of
randomly selected households across the country including neighborhoods that have been habitually undercounted by comparing
the survey results against the census the percentage of residents not included in the original
count can be estimated the idea was initially endorsed by several key officials with the
census bureau but the reagan administration rejected the technique prompting protests from critics who accused
the president of playing politics as the critics saw it the republican president opposed the
concept because of a probable rise in population totals in areas that are democratic strongholds
as a result those regions would gain congressional seats and more federal money several large
states and cities including california and los angeles sued to reverse reagan's decision the result
was a settlement in that created an eight member committee that will recommend whether the
survey results should be used to adjust the nation's population but politics could still come
into play the survey's advocates contend because the final decision expected in mid-july rests with
secretary of commerce robert mosbacher a republican political appointee while the intrigue continues in washington
the mood in orange county has remained one of optimism of hope that all segments
of society will be counted on april census day i'm hoping the census will be
the beginning of a reorientation in the way we see ourselves here in orange county
father soto said one of the critical issues facing the county will be ethnic pluralism
how we choose to engage the reality of who we are the census could be
a pivotal beginning to bringing that reality to us and making us face it times

street smart a ticklish route from disneyland
$BODY
january monday orange county edition words dear street smart for years there has been a
major problem experienced by disneyland visitors who wish to go north on the santa ana
freeway after exiting the park and proceeding north on west street they must turn right
onto ball road then work their way over to the left hand lanes so that
once they've crossed the freeway they can make a left turn across the westbound lanes
and onto the freeway entrance caltrans is building a new bridge where ball road crosses
the freeway it is my understanding that when this new bridge is completed disneyland visitors
will still have to work their way over to the left lanes on this new
bridge so they can make a left turn across traffic on ball road to reach
the freeway entrance why would anyone spend millions of dollars on a new bridge without
making provision to safely handle the many cars traveling east on ball road that would
like to enter the northbound santa ana freeway richard c martin anaheim that freeway entrance
is a doozy the kind that makes motorists wish they were safely back on the
autopia in the magic kingdom but officials at caltrans have a ready explanation for why
they won't be eliminating the troublesome left turn on ball road given their druthers the
agency's highway engineers admit they would like to install a cloverleaf type freeway entrance that
would siphon eastbound traffic off ball road's right hand lane and swing it on a
curving strip of asphalt down onto the northbound santa ana freeway no muss no fuss
and no left hand turn unfortunately the land needed for such a serpentine freeway ramp
is occupied by a motel caltrans officials say the agency cannot justify purchasing the property
and removing the motel just for a new freeway ramp instead they plan to do
the next best thing as part of the bridge construction caltrans will erect a new
left turn signal and add an extra left turn lane off ball road onto the
northbound santa ana freeway it is hoped that the new turn lanes and traffic light
which will be synchronized with signals on nearby harbor boulevard will help all those mouseketeer
groupies and tinkerbell fans get onto the freeway a whole lot easier dear street smart
like everyone in the los angeles basin i have become increasingly concerned with our traffic
problems the only solutions i see being offered appear to involve large sums of money
and long term projects the solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the
road the obvious answer is car-pooling unfortunately most people give up on the idea because
of the hassles involved in coordinating everyone i would like to see local newspapers run
advertising at no charge to commuters listing where people live and work using the coordinates
from a thomas brothers map book this would provide a quick reference for people who
live and work near one another and who have similar work schedules to form a
car pool many large companies use a similar system for their employees i am suggesting
that this could be tried on an areawide basis much has been written about the
number of single driver vehicles on the freeways i think this plan could be a
very logical way to reduce that number and speed up traffic on our freeway system
and it could be done with the least cost to the taxpayer thomas c moore
orange it's nice to see someone thinking about promoting car-pooling which many transportation experts say
is an important weapon in the battle to ease traffic congestion in the region those
same experts however say that putting together such a commuter bulletin board in local newspapers
might prove ineffective since many residents are squeamish about public listings of their addresses and
phone numbers also there is already a program to serve this purpose it is called
commuter computer and it offers motorists information about others who live and work near them
in an effort to encourage the formation of car pools those interested can call commuter
computer at 636-ride for information on car pools van pools and the nearest park-and-ride lot
a very valid point seat belts save lives just ask any chp officer or ambulance
driver street smart encourages motorists to use them even if they sometime wrinkle your tie

homicides set record in county
$BODY
january monday orange county edition words from a 4-year-old boy slain in a hail of
gang gunfire to a topless bar owner ambushed inside his limousine a record number of
people became homicide victims in orange county during the killings recorded for the year by
the orange county coroner's office up to new year's eve far surpassed the previous record
of homicides set in the total easily topped the slayings in in and in law
enforcement officials studying the grim statistics say they cannot pinpoint any specific causes for the
nearly rise in the number of people who died at the hands of others in
they can only note a general increase in violence in society and evidence that a
growing number of people carry guns homicides are just one of those things for which
there are no explanations garden grove lt chuck gibbs said certainly it is difficult to
find a satisfying explanation for the death of 4-year-old frank fernandez jr caught in the
gang cross fire in september as he stood in his family's driveway in garden grove
or for the kidnap and murder of 9-year-old nadia puente of santa ana in march
or for the slaying of 12-year-old jacalyn calabrese who was shot and killed in the
mall of orange last month as a schoolmate showed off his caliber pistol while many
of last year's murders seem particularly senseless others were carried out with the precision of
a gangland murder horace joseph mckenna known as big mac was shot through the rear
passenger window of his limousine as it pulled up to the gate of his expansive
estate in brea's carbon canyon mckenna a former california highway patrol officer and a 6-foot
6-inch bodybuilder was under investigation for hidden ownership in several nude and topless bars at
the time of his death no arrests have been made while no tally was available
for each city anaheim appeared to have posted one of the largest increases in homicides
there were killings in an increase of over the previous year police chief joseph t
molloy said that little changed in his city last year in terms of the provocation
for homicide fights between family members and drunken brawls were again the most common situations
that led to homicide in the county's most populous city in a lot of the
homicides we're investigating the victim and suspect knew each other he said for all the
concern and publicity about drugs and gangs only four of the killings appeared to be
directly linked to the narcotics trade he said and echoing the comments of police officials
in other cities molloy added that gang activity accounts for relatively few killings around the
county while anaheim the sheriff's department and santa ana report an upswing in homicides garden
grove actually experienced a reduction gibbs said the city had four fewer homicides in recording
eight as the year drew to a close but just as no one has a
good answer for why the county's homicide rate surged last year gibbs is at a
loss to explain the good news in his city we've been real fortunate gibbs said
i don't know why there's no way to track this stuff or predict it

$BODY
january monday orange county edition words donald bott of san clemente claimed he was terminated
from his 17-year job as santa ana's director of personnel in because of his age
and his efforts to expose wrongdoing in city hiring six months ago a jury decided
it didn't believe him but last week superior court judge leonard goldstein said he did
and overturned the jury's verdict awarding bott million the case is a good example of
the difficulties involved in proving a wrongful termination lawsuit courts and legislatures are providing an
increasing amount of protection for employees from indiscriminate firings but many of the laws are
complicated nearly all require anybody terminated to act quickly if he or she hopes to
win a verdict against a former employer tustin attorney harris e kershnar has represented more
than individuals who have sued their former employers for wrongful termination he spent the early
part of his career defending employers from such suits but changed sides in i'm philosophically
more comfortable representing the underdog he said kershnar now serves on the american bar assn
s equal employment opportunity committee and is a former chairman of the labor law section
of the orange county bar assn he graduated from the law school at uc berkeley
he recently spoke with times staff writer gregory crouch about how fired employees can vindicate
themselves in court q what types of wrongful termination cases have you typically argued a
they are a varied lot one was a case involving a large oil company that
conducted searches of employees vehicles and lockers as well as the employees themselves the employee
i represented was discharged because a marijuana cigarette was found in his car the jury
reached a verdict in favor of the employee on the grounds the employer violated an
expressed agreement not to discharge people without good cause plus there was an inadequate showing
that the marijuana was his and there wasn't much in the way of precedent to
establish that drugs found inside a car amounted to grounds for terminating someone when there
was no indication he had ever used drugs at work or ever reported to work
under the influence of drugs on a different subject altogether i handled an age discrimination
case against a trucking company where there was a manager who thought my client was
too old to be a driver and didn't hesitate to communicate that in front of
other employees my client was fired for a minor driving accident which would not have
typically resulted in the termination of a driver the case was settled on terms we
thought were quite favorable and i had a case where an employee was fired for
refusing to fire somebody else who declined to take a lie detector test it's illegal
to require someone to take a lie detector test and my client was told to
fire an employee who exercised his right to decline such a test my client told
the president of the company it was illegal for him to fire this person and
in turn my client was fired my client won a verdict on the basis his
firing was contrary to the public policy of the state of california q how common
is it for somebody to get fired a exceedingly common people who feel they have
been improperly terminated call up virtually on a daily basis nearly everyone who is fired
feels that it was improper or unfair but the real question is how many have
a legal remedy because what's unfair does not equal what is unlawful i don't have
a percentage for you but a small percent of the unfair terminations fall into categories
where the law provides a remedy q so what are the different categories a the
primary area is in civil rights laws covering age race sex religion national origin and
physical handicap firings based upon any of those categories is prohibited based upon the fair
employment and housing act which is a california statute discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation is not prohibited by the terms of the acts but there are serval cities
that have municipal ordinances that prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians including laguna beach los
angeles and san francisco q what if the reason for somebody's dismissal doesn't coincide with
one of the civil rights classifications a there are a number of individual pigeonholes it's
illegal to fire someone because they have brought a wage claim before the labor commission
it's illegal to fire an employee for disclosing his wages to a fellow employee you
cannot be fired for reporting to state or federal authorities any illegalities that you plausibly
believe are occuring at your employer for example if you think your employer is violating
environmental laws by dumping petroleum products into sewers instead of disposing of them in a
proper manner and your employer fired you for blowing the whistle on them that would
be unlawful if you are fired because you attempt to organize a union that is
unlawful under the national labor relations act if you are fired by the company to
try and deprive you of your pension that is prohibited under the employee retirement income
security act finally if you are fired because you performed jury service when summoned that
is unlawful q what if you were simply fired without warning or good cause a
the category most people fall under is that involving an expressed or implied employment contract
which limits the employer's right to terminate for instance if an employer has a progressive
discipline policy requiring warnings or other procedures prior to termination but does not follow that
an employee can bring a contract based action for improper termination q how can an
employee find out whether his or her company has such a policy a many employers
issue employee handbooks which would contain such a policy and if you're a supervisor you
have probably received instruction from your employer as to the discipline of employees if a
policy is not in your employee handbook ask your supervisor or the personnel department q
besides what's contained in the employee handbook are there other things a company does that
imply a contractual relationship a aside from written policy there is also the issue of
actual practice even if there is not a piece of paper that says a company
will follow progressive discipline but the way the employer disciplines employees amounts to a practice
of progressive discipline then employees are entitled to be treated in the same manner there
is an aspect of what's called the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
which holds that like cases should be treated alike for example if employees who are
tardy or absent are normally cautioned at least two times before being fired and a
prospective client walks into my office and says he was absent once and was fired
for that absence and there had been no other infractions committed by him the employer
would not be treating like cases alike q what about performance appraisals a verbal and
written communications by superiors are important for example if your boss told you that you
had a bright future with the company and you bypass opportunities elsewhere that would strengthen
the claim for you based on an implied contract make sure performance appraisals are done
because they will document whether you are or are not doing a good job and
that is another factor looked at in implied contract cases if you have a series
of favorable evaluations and then all of a sudden you are told your performance warrants
termination that is not going to carry the day unless they can show some very
specific misdeeds on the employee's part the handbook appraisals and length of service are all
building blocks of an implied contract q should an employee ask to see his personnel
file if he smells trouble a yes every employee in california has a statutory right
to inspect his personnel file and ought to exercise that right so the employee knows
whether he or she has been written up the employee should send a written response
to the head of the personnel department and ask that a copy be placed in
his personnel file while the incident is fresh in his mind and he has an
opportunity to clear it up because employees come and go it might be important for
the employee to speak to other employees at the time this occurs because other employees
input may be critical to substantiating the employee's version of the incident q are there
some firings that cannot be challenged in court a if an employee was truly what
is called at will that employee can be let go for no reason someone who
is an at-will employee doesn't have a contract implied or expressed the united states is
very unusual in that regard among western nations in western europe there typically must be
some legitimate basis for termination otherwise employees can obtain some monetary compensation but in california
if an employee is truly at will and doesn't fall into any of the pigeonholes
of the civil rights laws or specific statutory prohibitions he can be fired because the
employer wakes up on the wrong side of the bed q are at-will firings common
a i screen out many more cases than i accept because the circumstance don't seem
to be such that the law will provide a remedy there are many times when
people describe circumstances which strike me as unfair but they don't have any legal recourse
q how soon must a fired employee decide whether he will sue a it's important
for individuals to act in a timely manner because even if you fall into a
category where the law would permit relief if you wait too long you lose your
rights the time frames for each statute vary but an employee should never let a
full year lapse before proceeding against an employer ideally you should act more promptly than
that while witnesses are available and recollections are fresh employment cases are almost always hard
fought and employers typically have much greater resources than individuals the typical plaintiff is by
definition unemployed and suffering disastrous financial consequences q can an employee with a medical condition
be fired a when employees have been on a substantial medical leave because of a
non-work-related condition which does not amount to a physical handicap they can be fired the
man in the street feels it's grossly unfair yet there is nothing unlawful about it
take somebody who was seriously injured but not crippled in an automobile accident that wasn't
work related the person is not considered handicapped in the strictest sense of the law
because they don't have a permanent disabling condition the employer might say you are fired
because it won't wait until you are ready to come back and the employee has
no recourse the person may be entitled to state disability insurance but that doesn't force
the employer to retain the employee those two are not tied together q how much
is the fired employee going to have to spend on legal fees a typically employment
attorneys including me handle cases on a contingency basis and that's another reason why it's
important for plaintiff practitioners to carefully evaluate cases you can't make a living unless you
win a fair percentage of the time if there is a valid claim i'm willing
not to bill the client but take a contingency when and if we prevail q
is there anything an employee can do to make a wrongful termination case airtight a
the best thing to do if you can is to have an expressed contract and
almost the only time you will get that is when you are coming on board
with a company because that is the honeymoon period when an employer wants someone with
a specific skill or talent short of that it's important for an employee to document
any agreement or promises that an employer makes take a sales employee who is told
verbally that if he reaches in sales in a specific time period he will receive
an extra bonus if i were that employee i would write a memo to that
effect and send it to the person who sent it to me in accordance with
our discussion if i reach x dollars in sales i will be entitled to x
percent extra commission so as not to be too crass because tact is always important
the employee might do that in the text of a memo about the extra sales
efforts they intend to pursue to achieve the company's goal q what kind of employees
realistically could get such an agreement a i think executives are the people who typically
have an agreement of this type q what should prospective employees look for in an
employer a employees considering joining a company should ask the personnel department to see a
copy of the employee handbook and procedures carefully read what that employer says in its
official documents regarding how it's prepared to treat its employees also employees should be very
wary of forms placed in front of them which may vary from what they have
been told are the terms of their employment for example a manager recruiting an engineer
from another aerospace company may make all sorts of promises regarding bonuses career opportunities et
cetera and yet the day they come on board they may have a document placed
in front of them saying something like i am aware no one has authority to
make any promises to me regarding length of employment and i can be terminated at
any time for any reason six or seven months later that employee is fired under
circumstances which the employee believes to be unlawful and lo and behold the management lawyer
takes out exhibit this preprinted form which says the employee can be fired any time
for any reason and says didn't you sign this and of course you read it
and understood it didn't you if you are asked to sign such a document read
it very carefully and scratch out anything that contradicts what has been promised you q
should a fired employee accept severance pay if he is thinking of suing a employers
do not have a legal obligation to pay severance the fired employee presented with a
severance package needs to assess whether the money being offered is worth accepting in exchange
for giving up your potential claims the average employee would probably need to consult counsel
to determine whether they had a claim and its likely worth compared to the severance
package being offered q if your case does go to trial how much can you
win in damages a that depends on the law the suit is based on in
an implied contract claim punitive damages those designed to punish and deter similar treatment in
the future are not available to you regardless of the outrageousness of the employer's conduct
you can get all out-of-pocket losses lost wages and lost benefits plus any catastrophic losses
which flowed from the termination for example an employee out of work might lose his
home because he can't make the mortgage payments emotional distress damages can also be pursued
if such distress foreseeably resulted from the termination under the fair employment and housing act
you can get everything i just described plus punitive damages and attorney's fees so if
a person was sexually harassed at work and brought a claim under the feha the
remedies are potentially much greater than someone whose contract was breached

a ticket she said that her interest in t s o l had been handed
down from an older generation of punkers an aunt and uncle now in their 20s
and 30s robert mora a tall hulking punk rock fan from hollywood said he used
to go see the original t s o l in los angeles when he was
barely in his teens mora grumbled about how he could get in for as little
as to in those days compared to the he had paid to see t s
o l s reunion for all the money they're getting they'd better have a lot
of energy he said as it turned out t s o l had enough energy
to get by but not enough focus or group cohesiveness to infuse the show with
much beyond nostalgia value bassist mike roche who came out wearing a top hat and
red bandanna on his head and a skull mask on his face kept up a
fast rumbling pulse along with drummer todd barnes but the rhythm section only occasionally kicked
the beat to a surging peak guitarist ron emory generated the most musical excitement of
the bunch consistently churning out raw slashing riffs and solos that often took on a
charged rockabilly edge reminiscent of billy zoom's work during the punk heyday of x emory
now a member of lunchbox captured the roaring spirit of punk rock with his one
lead vocal of the night spitting out convincing scorn for authority during die for me
emory and lead singer jack grisham also raised some effective punk ire with their call-and-response
screams on one thrashing number unfortunately that was the only truly interactive moment of the
50-minute show for the most part roche stayed in the background and emory played in
self contained if intense solitude at stage right leaving grisham to caper about in his
old role as t s o l s ringleader and rabble rouser grisham alluded to
the fact that the band hadn't played together in seven years but there wasn't a
flicker of warmth and sentiment between these old cronies no smiles exchanged no pinball style
physical contact between players always helpful for a punk show not even an introduction of
the band members or a mutual bow at the end the old personal animosities that
split the band apart didn't surface but the four t s o l alumni appeared
only to have contrived a truce for business purposes not a reconciliation born of rediscovered
fondness for the good old days and each other still this aloofness was better and
more true to the take us as we are punk ethic than a feigned camaraderie
would have been the concert wound up being mainly a vehicle for grisham the big
lithe naturally charismatic front man who spent the show moving about in graceful loping strides
grisham who now leads the hard rock band tender fury doesn't have an exceptionally rangy
or powerful voice but he hammed it up with the theatrical half crooned half spoken
vocals that distinguished t s o l from its more snarling hard core punk competitors
the or so songs that t s o l performed all were drawn from the
two eps and two albums the original band released during its original run from to
one of the early t s o l s virtues was its willingness to experiment
with musical styles the band changed with each recording and that paid off in its
reunion by allowing for a variety of tone a rarity among punk rockers there were
thrashing politically oriented songs that railed at authority the lighter more melodic approach of the
reggae inflected word is the disgusting but funny necrophiliac fantasy of code blue and textured
melodrama on songs like the triangle with its spy story full of paranoia and the
stormily romantic wash away most of the songs came off as grist for grisham's performance
rather than as deeply felt expression in which the song itself mattered more than the
singer grisham has said he got into punk rock as a teen ager because he
saw it as an outlet for his adolescent delight in all-purpose hell raising his instigator's
streak surfaced at the celebrity as he egged on an already tumultuous crowd to leap
over a wooden barrier and on to the stage the many who tried didn't fare
very well a cordon of linebacker size security men would grasp each would-be stage crasher
in a bear hug and hustle the intruder out of the auditorium but if the
aim of singer and audience was to recreate the tumult of the good old days
of punk they pretty much succeeded whether out of savvy instinct or blind luck grisham
picked just the right moment to stall the show and let emotions subside at the
point when the turbulence in front of the stage threatened to get out of hand
he did so by taking off his shoes and promising to perform naked but grisham
stripped to the waist through most of the show managed to keep his leather tights
and codpiece in place for the remainder of the concert the biggest surprise of the
show was grisham's announcement from the stage that what was to have been a one-time
reunion will have a sequel tuesday night at raji's nightclub in hollywood that show will
be recorded for a live album peter heur president of triple x records said the
second show was arranged to avoid a fee that the celebrity theatre required to record
friday night's concert the decision to do a live album which heur said will be
a joint release by triple x and enigma records will have consequences for mike roche
until now roche had been the last original member of t s o l still
playing with the second generation version of t s o l which has continued to
tour and record since while phasing out punk music in favor of a blues rock
and heavy metal slant roche's partners in the current t s o l joe wood
and mitch dean had consented to his playing friday's reunion only after much internal haggling
that threatened to split the band the current members said they aren't going to stand
for roche taking part in a reunion album as well and roche said in a
post show interview that he is being ousted from t s o l as a
result they said if i do this record i'm out of the band roche said
i'm doing the show at raji's if it is so bitter and they want to
replace me i don't want to play with them any more we can't keep riding
the merry-go-round roche said he is considering legal action either to prevent wood and dean
from continuing to use the name t s o l or to gain financial compensation
for use of the name he says he originated wood confirmed saturday that the current
t s o l was planning to perform saturday night in montclair with a new
bass player dave mello i have the ideal band i'm happy wood said dismissing the
notion that roche has more claim to the t s o l name than he
and dean wood has maintained that roche's personal problems more than the tension over the
original t s o l s reunion have undermined roche's position in the band if
mike gets his stuff together he's welcome back in the current t s o l
he needs to get his priorities lined up

art early exhibits to display contemporary look

january monday orange county edition words well out with the old year in with the
new what's coming up on the visual arts scene in orange county happily some impressive
sounding shows nearly all devoted to contemporary work are on tap for the first six
months of one important point to keep in mind while it's great for our museums
and galleries to host fine shows organized elsewhere an institution's real prestige comes from having
done the planning thinking and legwork on its own newport's first big blast for the
year opens april objectives the new sculpture through june is chief curator paul schimmel's last
project before he leaves for the museum of contemporary art in los angeles the show
presents a type of work by younger american and european artists that has come to
dominate the offerings of a number of major galleries in l a new york and
europe called neo-geo or simulationism in the united states this work is about our attitudes
toward everyday objects and the way they reflect assumptions held by the society that produced
them without knowing these works were created by artists and meant to carry a particular
set of meanings viewers are likely to see such pieces merely as mass produced kitsch
a bizarre kind of window dressing or the whims of an eccentric collector clearly work
such as this cries out for explication a task that a museum survey is equipped
to undertake artists in the show include the much lauded much derided jeff koons as

warhol came to new york from pittsburgh a 21-year-old with a design degree from carnegie
tech his early jobs were with ad agencies fashion magazines and department stores the show's
title comes from a magazine article warhol illustrated a few years later he was hired
to design book jackets and record albums and he dabbled in image shaping for retail
stores only in did he give up commercial stints to focus on his own art

the marshal of controversy touched by a scandal sen john glenn will still be an astronaut hero to many when leading tournament of roses parade
$BODY
january monday home edition john glenn words it has been a bit of a sticky
wicket conceded tournament of roses president don fedde we don't like controversy more than anybody
else let's put it that way but here was fedde a genial 52-year-old furniture store
owner who has served the tournament faithfully for years finally getting his shot at the
top job and with it the honor of choosing the grand marshal for today's rose
parade and bingo controversy on oct with flair and flourishes former astronaut john h glenn
now a u s senator from ohio was announced as grand marshal for today's 101st
tournament of roses parade announcing his choice fedde had praised glenn as a hero with
steely nerves and harmonious hometown values on oct in what fedde understatedly describes as an
unfortunate bit of timing the common cause citizens lobby called for investigations of five senators
including glenn and california's alan cranston on charges they improperly interfered with a federal investigation
of now-bankrupt lincoln savings amp loan in irvine the senate ethics committee announced weeks ago
that it was beginning a preliminary investigation to determine whether the five had abused their
office glenn's integrity heretofore untarnished is being questioned the key issue being whether lincoln owner
charles keating bought glenn's influence with a contribution to a political action committee controlled by
the ohio senator on selection day we had thought it was the greatest pick we
could have made fedde said adding that glenn had been a noncontroversial choice for grand
marshal a standout among the dozen or so finalists that included musicians actors and former
presidents now the committee was left to wonder if its hero might have feet of
clay he emphasized that there was never any serious thought given to uninviting glenn we
couldn't find any basis he said there's nothing but innuendo the innuendo has been very
heavy admittedly but we think we know all the facts as the keating scandal grew
fedde made it his business to learn everything he could about it i read every
article taped every program he said from washington fedde obtained a copy of the transcript
of the meeting that took place in april with the five senators and federal thrift
regulators a meeting called at the urging of charles keating from glenn he got a
copy of an eight page statement the senator wrote around thanksgiving explaining what he did
and did not do and concluding my life has been and remains an open book
it's been a life based on decency honor integrity and the highest ethical standards i
have not changed and with every fiber in my being i resent anyone implying otherwise
never fedde said was there one terrible moment of crisis when the tournament's nine-man executive
committee sat down and asked themselves what do we do now it was more a
matter of worrying about how big this thing was going to get and how soon
although they continued to read about the savings and loan scandal and glenn fedde said
we have looked into it deeply and we feel his conscience is clear and we
think time will prove our decision to be the right one to proceed with him
he is a national hero and we still consider him so we just want to
honor a space pioneer sure some may be critical of the tournament's choice for grand
marshal fedde shrugged last year the honor went to shirley temple black hardly a wildly
controversial figure and he said we even got letters on her meanwhile glenn for his
part appeared to be enjoying himself enormously as he dutifully worked his way through three
days of formalities leading up to the parade in an interview friday morning shortly after
returning from a jog he said he wasn't worried about the keating scandal not at
all that'll all come out all right i'm not concerned everything will be ok he
added when what i did not do comes out had he at any time considered
withdrawing as grand marshal no not at all i had no reason to step down
if people have been misled by the media well i'm sorry about that but i
know the american people to be very fair for the long haul glenn said he
is not concerned in the short run he acknowledged his implication in the keating affair
is very irritating as for the rose parade and rose bowl game we've watched every
year on tv he said of course i'd hoped maybe ohio state not michigan might
be here i guess we're character building this year the entire glenn family will be
on hand annie his wife will ride with him in the stands will be their
son dr david glenn an anesthesiologist in san francisco his wife karen and their sons
daniel and zachary as well as the glenns daughter lyn who lives in st paul
glenn hopes to get some good film along the route with his new hand held
camcorder there is no indication that he intends to let the cloud of scandal rain
on his parade we're looking forward to it he said i'm really getting a big
kick out of it it's a great honor at his first official appearance as grand
marshal at the annual kiwanis kickoff luncheon friday at the pasadena center the reception glenn
received indicated that in the eyes of the public he is still the bona fide
hero who became the first american to orbit the globe in the little friendship capsule
one february morning years ago as he was introduced by fedde as the perfect person
to lead this year's parade glenn the world war ii bomber pilot korean war fighter
pilot and a test pilot who once set a transcontinental speed record received a steady
round of applause building to a crescendo then to a standing ovation he responsed with
a patriotic pep talk in which he spoke of walls tumbling down and dictators tumbling
down throughout eastern europe a fit and youthful looking glenn who became a multimillionaire through
investments in hotels and who briefly was a democratic presidential candidate breezed through a saturday
morning of television interviews at tournament house in pasadena he described for one interviewer how
weightlessness in space feels talked about the california sunshine and the bitter cold back home
in ohio fedde seemed well pleased everything seemed harmonious nicely in keeping with this year's
parade theme a world of harmony that theme had proved to be an inspired choice
this particular year although fedde acknowledged what we had in mind was the wonderful reagan
gorbachev relationship how were we to know about these incredible world events still the accolades
for omniscience were music to his ears in a year when tournament bashing appeared to
be in vogue although there have been reports that parade and game tickets were all
but going begging not so fedde said sales he said were only minutely off and
there were the critics asking once again if it is moral to spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars to build pretty floats when there are thousands of people hungry and
homeless there's always an anti establishment element fedde said observing that the festivities are more
than just a party that million in television revenues are divided among the big and
pac schools besides he observed on a cost per impression basis a float is one
of the best bargains in the world for corporate america it's advertising pr so why
not say it in a joyous beautiful way he was more concerned about glitches that
could arise even after months of planning what was going to happen to the people
who traditionally park on the other side of the arroyo and walk over colorado bridge
the bridge has been closed as unsafe but he knows they're not going to be
aware of it until new year's morning a giant robot the parade entry from general
motors united auto workers had been a potential troublemaker feet wide that's feet over what's
allowed the committee worked that one out said fedde we've put the arms on separate
circuits so one arm can go down when the other one comes up the committee
he said had been very very busy dealing with requests for exceptions to size limits
we don't want the parade to be a size race a budget race or a
horsepower race fedde had just received a memo from one of his staff with the
information that the lead car in this year's parade a chrysler imperial phaeton limousine was
the very car that appeared in the film the right stuff carrying actor ed harris
as astronaut glenn in the tumultuous new york ticker tape parade in his honor in
glenn greeted this news with his opinion that the whole film should have been left
on the cutting room floor it was all about to happen horses parades floats and
an embattled american hero as grand marshal fedde emphasized that all of his opinions on
the glenn matter were just that his opinions adding nothing in this world is absolutely
certain we're running on faith and that's all you can do times staff writer david

era ends as jones exits top post at northrop corp aerospace in his years as chief executive he led the company from relative obscurity to a place as a major military prime contractor
$BODY
january monday home edition thomas v jones words the last of the aerospace industry titans
the men who became synonymous with their corporations and the aircraft they produced is gone
with the departure of thomas v jones as chief executive of northrop corp jones who
at northrop's helm for years came to personify the maverick aerospace company and who survived
an astonishing succession of personal controversies will remain its chairman but will retire today as
an employee of the company in recent weeks the aerospace industry has rushed to give
jones several major awards for his career accomplishments adding to the long list of recognitions
that he has received as an aviation leader the city of hawthorne even named a
park for him but jones is stepping down from his post with the company still
under indictment on criminal charges and facing several investigations by federal grand juries in los
angeles and elsewhere and although he undoubtedly built northrop into a leading prime contractor the
success of his legacy depends on the outcome of several risky programs they don't make
them like jones anymore said paine webber aerospace analyst joseph campbell jones is the last
of the old guard it is the passing of an era rightfully so jones declined
to be interviewed for this story a northrop spokesman said jones was so busy that
he had no time to talk jones came from a time when aerospace chiefs made
gutsy big gambles on new technology and jones made some of the biggest wagers in
history he bet billion of shareholder money on the f-20 jet fighter during the 1980s
and failed to sell one but he also gambled big on the b-2 stealth bomber
program and turned the industry on its ear by winning in the process he transformed
a relatively small and flagging aerospace company in the late 1950s into one of the
major military prime contractors in the nation he took northrop to a commanding position at
least technologically and in the engineering systems to exploit that technology said prudential bache analyst
paul nisbet he has been a strong factor in bringing the company to where it
is though there is divided opinion over exactly where that is jones is leaving with
the company deeply in debt and with a market value of just million less than
what two of his stealth bombers cost northrop is teetering on the edge of tremendous
success or virtual extinction depending on the outcome of the b-2 and the advanced tactical
fighter or atf programs however those programs fare jones was a driving force behind the
development of the f-5 jet fighter the t-38 air force trainer and the navy yf-17
which became the basis for the current f-18 jet fighter he should be remembered as
an enormously effective pioneer of new airplanes said thomas o paine a former northrop president
he has an incredibly powerful personal determination to succeed against all odds but jones had
another side to his personality a penchant for bold acts that often carried an unnecessary
risk according to another former colleague jones brings to mind that statement from adm arleigh
burke give me a strong ship for i intend to sail into harm's way well
tom liked to sail into harm's way the former colleague said tom gets a big
kick out of getting into trouble and then getting out he added it is ingrained
in his personality jones got into more trouble and survived more often than probably any
contemporary aerospace executive in jones signed a consent agreement with the securities and exchange commission
in which he promised not to bribe any foreign officials that was after the company
had allegedly paid out million to foreign officials in connection with international arms deals northrop
under jones became the consummate international arms merchant selling its f-5 jet fighter to nations
from norway to saudi arabia jones became close to the shah of iran and at
one time proudly displayed a persian rug at the company headquarters that was a gift
from the shah jones also pleaded guilty to a federal felony count during the watergate
scandal in which he admitted to falsifying documents involving political contributions that were linked to
a richard nixon slush fund in the aftermath jones agreed to form a board of
directors that was constituted almost entirely of outsiders but that board eventually became a source
of support for him backing such risky jones ventures as the f-20 atf and b-2
there isn't much more you can accomplish said william ballhaus a board member who has
known jones throughout his career robert l j long another board member said jones made
some significant contributions to the whole aerospace industry but ballhaus and long sought to dispel
any doubt that kent kresa the president and new chief executive is in full control
of the company mr jones precise role will be determined by kresa long said ballhaus
said it is a transition from the jones era and it will now be the
kresa era as a non-employee jones is free to go sail a boat i am
sure he will not be there at his office every day the kresa era will
also begin with a substantially new slate of top executives since the start of eight
of northrop's elected corporate officers many of whom were jones cronies have left most recently
northrop general counsel william m elliott quietly departed the company at a time of legal
turmoil the company is facing probes by federal grand juries in texas hawaii and california
one inquiry is into whether million in payments to koreans violated the u s foreign
corrupt practices act the company was also indicted on federal charges of criminal fraud earlier
this year in los angeles despite all these problems jones departure was not forced on
him according to knowledgeable sources a former northrop executive said it was a situation where
jones himself recognized it was time to leave there were people in washington in the
air force and at the pentagon who let it be known that they would not
be unhappy if he retired

ex-agent's ties to noriega give israelis pause mercenaries mike harari once worked for mossad but he became the panama strongman's right hand man
$BODY
january monday home edition mike harari words the news proved false but a report last
week that mike harari an israeli mercenary and right hand man to deposed panamanian strongman
manuel a noriega was under arrest caused brief anxiety among government officials here harari is
a former agent in the mossad israel's intelligence agency who gained prominence as a figure
in business and arms dealings between israel and panama of which he was reported to
take hefty commissions harari also trained anti terrorist and private security squads for noriega israeli
diplomats in panama and american congressmen have warned israel on several occasions that if noriega
and washington collided harari could prove to be an embarrassment before word arrived that u
s troops had in fact not detained harari officials here had already moved to disown
him whatever he was doing he was doing it on his own they insisted he
is a private citizen as far as i know he has no connection with the
government of israel said yosef amihud a spokesman for the foreign ministry relatives of harari
say that he is in israel israel radio reported last week it is not yet
clear whether harari would face charges in panama if he were captured harari is the
second prominent israeli whose tangled relationships with suspected latin american drug dealers made israel blush
last year officials in colombia accused yair klein a retired army colonel of training killers
on behalf of cocaine smugglers klein said he was training cattle ranchers to defend themselves
against terrorists the harari and klein cases had another common thread both men evidently traded
on skills that have limited marketability in their home country once their official services ended
there are more than israeli companies that export anti terrorist paramilitary and security training overseas
most are manned by former soldiers and intelligence agents harari's long career with the mossad
included some of the agency's most deadly missions he headed a force of hit squads
to kill palestinian terrorists in europe harari's mossad career seemed at an end when in
the mid-1970s one of the hit squads mistook a moroccan waiter in norway for an
arab terrorist and shot him dead harari also served as mossad chief for mexico and
central america before retiring in the late 1970s after leaving the mossad harari managed a
large insurance firm for a while published reports here said as early as harari was
reported to be selling arms to panama an israeli partnership that included harari won a
contract to harvest lumber in panama and he was a middleman in deals that led
to israeli participation in public works and telephone projects in panama in harari appeared in
jerusalem with credentials from the panamanian government appointing him honorary consul in israel and he
headed panama's commercial mission here that same year he was photographed wearing his trademark aviator
sunglasses escorting panama's civilian president at that time eric a delvalle around jerusalem israeli newspapers
reported that businessmen here resented harari because they said he demanded participation in any dealings
with panama mister his detractors called him in jose blandon noriega's former consul in new
york told u s congressional investigators that harari managed arms smuggling operations for noriega two
years ago israeli newspapers reported that washington asked israel to recall harari from panama but
jerusalem responded that it had no control over him but intelligence observers point out that
it is rare for former mossad officials to completely sever their links with the intelligence
agency it would strain relations with the u s if someone working for israel was
also undermining the americans in a place like panama said one observer

$BODY
january monday home edition john bushnell words the man who runs panama has an office
in the presidential palace and roars through town in a bulletproof limousine accompanied by armored
cars full of large heavily armed bodyguards who wear ominous dark glasses he decides who
can walk free and who goes to jail when citizens can be on the street
and when they have to be in their houses and even what avenues are open
to traffic this man is not president guillermo endara nor is he the popular charismatic
2nd vice president guillermo billy ford nor the intellectual 1st vice president ricardo arias calderon
he isn't even a panamanian and if you thought well it must be the american
ambassador you would be wrong the man who runs panama is a middle aged career
diplomat who has never reached the rank of ambassador in fact he's never held a
post higher than that of the no diplomat in the american embassy in argentina he
is a tall stooped american with thinning hair and a desire not to be identified
in public his name is john bushnell and he is the closest thing the united
states has to a proconsul while endara a once obscure lawyer with no political following
is enjoying the public trappings of office a mercedes benz limousine a tricolored presidential sash
and bowing and scraping aides bushnell wears a simple white sport shirt and nondescript slacks
the only things that set him apart from the crowd are his security guards and
a white bulletproof vest that he wears outside his shirt but when the new panamanian
government was temporarily located in the foreign ministry the two vice presidents had their offices
in cramped quarters on the first floor while bushnell was ensconced next to endara in
comfortable rooms on the second floor he even lives in the same building where endara
ford and arias live near the american embassy if bushnell appears unassuming and his title
is nothing more than u s deputy chief of mission the people in the know
here know who to talk to when things need to be done when u s
troops stepped over the bounds of international law and violated the diplomatic sanctity of the
nicaraguan ambassador by raiding his official residence it was bushnell who was called and who
fixed things and when american troops were trying to unnerve ousted dictator manuel a noriega
by playing loud rock music outside his hiding place in the vatican embassy it was
bushnell who ordered the broadcasts toned down after the vatican's emissary complained that he couldn't
sleep bushnell is reported to have approved sending american troops to seal the area around
the peruvian embassy because of reports that noriega might seek asylum there and he was
the one the peruvian ambassador complained to no diplomat calls u s ambassador arthur davis
he doesn't count said a european envoy about davis the almost invisible political appointee who
is mocked by some associates as elmer fudd because he has a slight speech impediment
sources said that bushnell has signed off on curfew hours set for this capital city
and makes the final decisions on which former noriega officials and cronies are arrested and
says a senior embassy official who asked not to be identified until the panamanian government
is capable of assuming police and security functions the embassy is in operational control of
panama that means says a different official john bushnell bushnell's role is not the only
unusual aspect of life in panama in the wake of the dec american invasion part
of that invasion has been a massive influx of reporters and broadcast technicians at one
point the figure reached nearly many of whom had never covered a military operation nor
been near danger the number of journalists quickly overwhelmed the american military's capacity to deal
with them to pare down the total to something manageable the u s southern command
took an imaginative approach that showed more originality than some of its battle tactics first
the military made life very uncomfortable preventing reporters from leaving u s bases but not
providing places to sleep adequate facilities for filing their dispatches or sufficient food then the
soldiers turned to scare tactics after describing how his car had been shot at near
the american embassy and saying that it is war out there col ronald sconyers the
southern command's spokesman said a charter flight had been arranged to take anyone to miami
who wanted to go nearly of the journalists in the room immediately signed on for
the trip even though none had been outside of the american-run howard air base here
or had been in panama for more than hours even though noriega has been thoroughly
discredited and even the former dictator's most loyal supporters now sport endara t-shirts some signs
of the former regime remain standing feet tall on via espana one of panama city's
busiest streets is a huge poster unblemished by graffiti pronouncing carlos duque president duque was
noriega's handpicked presidential candidate who was embarrassingly trounced in last may's vote noriega ultimately annulled
the results duque is being sought by the u s military
